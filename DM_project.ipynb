been   dogmatist have failed to understand womenthat the terrible   seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid   their address to Truth have been unskilled and unseemly method for   winning a woman Certainly she ha never allowed herself to be won and   at present every kind of dogma stand with sad and discouraged mienIF   indeed it stand at all For there are scoffer who maintain that it   ha fallen that all dogma lie on the groundnay more that it is at   it last gasp But to speak seriously there are good ground for hoping   that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive   and decided air it ha assumed may have been only a noble puerilism   and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once   and again understood WHAT ha actually sufficed for the basis of such   imposing and absolute philosophical edifice a the dogmatist have   hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time   such a the soulsuperstition which in the form of subject and   egosuperstition ha not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some   play upon word a deception on the part of grammar or an   audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very   humanalltoohuman fact The philosophy of the dogmatist it is to   be hoped wa only a promise for thousand of year afterwards a wa   astrology in still earlier time in the service of which probably more   labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any   actual science hitherto we owe to it and to it superterrestrial   pretension in Asia and Egypt the grand style of architecture It seems   that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with   everlasting claim all great thing have first to wander about the   earth a enormous and aweinspiring caricature dogmatic philosophy ha   been a caricature of this kindfor instance the Vedanta doctrine in   Asia and Platonism in Europe Let u not be ungrateful to it although   it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome   and the most dangerous of error hitherto ha been a dogmatist   errornamely Platos invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself   But now when it ha been surmounted when Europe rid of this nightmare   can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthiersleep   we WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF are the heir of all the strength   which the struggle against this error ha fostered It amounted to   the very inversion of truth and the denial of the PERSPECTIVEthe   fundamental conditionof life to speak of Spirit and the Good a Plato   spoke of them indeed one might ask a a physician How did such a   malady attack that finest product of antiquity Plato Had the wicked   Socrates really corrupted him Was Socrates after all a corrupter of   youth and deserved his hemlock But the struggle against Plato   orto speak plainer and for the peoplethe struggle against   the ecclesiastical oppression of millennium of Christianity FOR   CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE PEOPLE produced in Europe   a magnificent tension of soul such a had not existed anywhere   previously with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the   furthest goal As a matter of fact the European feel this tension a   a state of distress and twice attempt have been made in grand style to   unbend the bow once by mean of Jesuitism and the second time by mean   of democratic enlightenmentwhich with the aid of liberty of the press   and newspaperreading might in fact bring it about that the spirit   would not so easily find itself in distress The Germans invented   gunpowderall credit to them but they again made thing squarethey   invented printing But we who are neither Jesuits nor democrat   nor even sufficiently Germans we GOOD EUROPEANS and free VERY free   spiritswe have it still all the distress of spirit and all the   tension of it bow And perhaps also the arrow the duty and who   know THE GOAL TO AIM AT     Sils Maria Upper Engadine JUNE 1885           CHAPTER I PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS       1 The Will to Truth which is to tempt u to many a hazardous   enterprise the famous Truthfulness of which all philosopher have   hitherto spoken with respect what question ha this Will to Truth not   laid before u What strange perplexing questionable question It is   already a long story yet it seems a if it were hardly commenced Is   it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn   impatiently away That this Sphinx teach u at last to ask question   ourselves WHO is it really that put question to u here WHAT really   is this Will to Truth in u In fact we made a long halt at the   question a to the origin of this Willuntil at last we came to an   absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question We inquired   about the VALUE of this Will Granted that we want the truth WHY NOT   RATHER untruth And uncertainty Even ignorance The problem of the   value of truth presented itself before usor wa it we who presented   ourselves before the problem Which of u is the Oedipus here Which   the Sphinx It would seem to be a rendezvous of question and note of   interrogation And could it be believed that it at last seems to u a   if the problem had never been propounded before a if we were the first   to discern it get a sight of it and RISK RAISING it For there is risk   in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk     2 HOW COULD anything originate out of it opposite For example truth   out of error or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception or the   generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sunbright vision of the   wise man out of covetousness Such genesis is impossible whoever dream   of it is a fool nay worse than a fool thing of the highest   value must have a different origin an origin of THEIR ownin this   transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of   delusion and cupidity they can not have their source But rather in   the lap of Being in the intransitory in the concealed God in the   ThinginitselfTHERE must be their source and nowhere elseThis   mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which   metaphysicians of all time can be recognized this mode of valuation   is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of   theirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that   is in the end solemnly christened the Truth The fundamental belief of   metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES It never occurred   even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where   doubt however wa most necessary though they had made a solemn   vow DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM For it may be doubted firstly whether   antithesis exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuation   and antithesis of value upon which metaphysicians have set their   seal are not perhaps merely superficial estimate merely provisional   perspective besides being probably made from some corner perhaps from   belowfrog perspective a it were to borrow an expression current   among painter In spite of all the value which may belong to the true   the positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higher   and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to   pretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity It   might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and   respected thing consists precisely in their being insidiously   related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed   thingsperhaps even in being essentially identical with them Perhaps   But who wish to concern himself with such dangerous Perhapses   For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of   philosopher such a will have other taste and inclination the   reverse of those hitherto prevalentphilosophers of the dangerous   Perhaps in every sense of the term And to speak in all seriousness I   see such new philosopher beginning to appear     3 Having kept a sharp eye on philosopher and having read between   their line long enough I now say to myself that the greater part of   conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive function and   it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one ha here to   learn anew a one learned anew about heredity and innateness As   little a the act of birth come into consideration in the whole process   and procedure of heredity just a little is beingconscious OPPOSED   to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the   conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his   instinct and forced into definite channel And behind all logic and   it seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuation or to speak   more plainly physiological demand for the maintenance of a definite   mode of life For example that the certain is worth more than the   uncertain that illusion is le valuable than truth such valuation   in spite of their regulative importance for US might notwithstanding be   only superficial valuation special kind of niaiserie such a may   be necessary for the maintenance of being such a ourselves Supposing   in effect that man is not just the measure of thing     4 The falseness of an opinion is not for u any objection to it it is   here perhaps that our new language sound most strangely The   question is how far an opinion is lifefurthering lifepreserving   speciespreserving perhaps speciesrearing and we are fundamentally   inclined to maintain that the falsest opinion to which the synthetic   judgment a priori belong are the most indispensable to u that   without a recognition of logical fiction without a comparison of   reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable   without a constant counterfeiting of the world by mean of number   man could not livethat the renunciation of false opinion would be   a renunciation of life a negation of life TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A   CONDITION OF LIFE that is certainly to impugn the traditional idea of   value in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which venture to do so   ha thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil     5 That which cause philosopher to be regarded halfdistrustfully   and halfmockingly is not the oftrepeated discovery how innocent they   arehow often and easily they make mistake and lose their way in   short how childish and childlike they arebut that there is not   enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud and   virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in   the remotest manner They all pose a though their real opinion had   been discovered and attained through the selfevolving of a cold pure   divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sort of mystic   who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact a   prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally   their heart desire abstracted and refined is defended by them with   argument sought out after the event They are all advocate who do not   wish to be regarded a such generally astute defender also of their   prejudice which they dub truthsand VERY far from having the   conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having   the good taste of the courage which go so far a to let this be   understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidence   and selfridicule The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant equally   stiff and decent with which he entices u into the dialectic   byway that lead more correctly mislead to his categorical   imperativemakes u fastidious one smile we who find no small   amusement in spying out the subtle trick of old moralist and ethical   preacher Or still more so the hocuspocus in mathematical form by   mean of which Spinoza ha a it were clad his philosophy in mail and   maskin fact the love of HIS wisdom to translate the term fairly   and squarelyin order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart   of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible   maiden that Pallas Athenehow much of personal timidity and   vulnerability doe this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray     6 It ha gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up   till now ha consisted ofnamely the confession of it originator and   a specie of involuntary and unconscious autobiography and moreover   that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy ha constituted   the true vital germ out of which the entire plant ha always grown   Indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertion of a   philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to first   ask oneself What morality do they or doe he aim at Accordingly   I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of   philosophy but that another impulse here a elsewhere ha only made   use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge a an instrument But whoever   considers the fundamental impulse of man with a view to determining   how far they may have here acted a INSPIRING GENII or a demon and   cobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time   or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to   look upon itself a the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate   LORD over all the other impulse For every impulse is imperious and a   SUCH attempt to philosophize To be sure in the case of scholar in   the case of really scientific men it may be otherwisebetter if   you will there there may really be such a thing a an impulse to   knowledge some kind of small independent clockwork which when well   wound up work away industriously to that end WITHOUT the rest of   the scholarly impulse taking any material part therein The actual   interest of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another   directionin the family perhaps or in moneymaking or in politics   it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little   machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a   good philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist he is not   CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that In the philosopher on the   contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all   his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony a to WHO HE   ISthat is to say in what order the deepest impulse of his nature   stand to each other     7 How malicious philosopher can be I know of nothing more stinging   than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the   Platonists he called them Dionysiokolakes In it original sense   and on the face of it the word signifies Flatterers of   Dionysiusconsequently tyrant accessory and lickspittles   besides this however it is a much a to say They are all ACTORS   there is nothing genuine about them for Dionysiokolax wa a popular   name for an actor And the latter is really the malignant reproach that   Epicurus cast upon Plato he wa annoyed by the grandiose manner the   mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholar were mastersof   which Epicurus wa not a master He the old schoolteacher of Samos   who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens and wrote three   hundred book perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato who   know Greece took a hundred year to find out who the gardengod   Epicurus really wa Did she ever find out     8 There is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of   the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the word of an   ancient mystery     Adventavit asinus Pulcher et fortissimus     9 You desire to LIVE according to Nature Oh you noble Stoics what   fraud of word Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature boundlessly   extravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or consideration   without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain   imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE a a powerhow COULD you live   in accordance with such indifference To liveis not that just   endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature Is not living valuing   preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different   And granted that your imperative living according to Nature mean   actually the same a living according to lifehow could you do   DIFFERENTLY Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves   are and must be In reality however it is quite otherwise with you   while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature   you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stageplayers   and selfdeluders In your pride you wish to dictate your moral and   ideal to Nature to Nature herself and to incorporate them therein   you insist that it shall be Nature according to the Stoa and would   like everything to be made after your own image a a vast eternal   glorification and generalism of Stoicism With all your love for truth   you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such   hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY that is to say Stoically   that you are no longer able to see it otherwiseand to crown all some   unfathomable superciliousness give you the Bedlamite hope that   BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselvesStoicism is   selftyrannyNature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is   not the Stoic a PART of Nature But this is an old and everlasting   story what happened in old time with the Stoics still happens today   a soon a ever a philosophy begin to believe in itself It always   creates the world in it own image it can not do otherwise philosophy   is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual Will to Power the   will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima     10 The eagerness and subtlety I should even say craftiness with   which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at   present throughout Europe furnishes food for thought and attention and   he who hears only a Will to Truth in the background and nothing else   can not certainly boast of the sharpest ear In rare and isolated   case it may really have happened that such a Will to Trutha certain   extravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of the   forlorn hopehas participated therein that which in the end always   prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful   possibility there may even be puritanical fanatic of conscience   who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in an   uncertain something But that is Nihilism and the sign of a despairing   mortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a   virtue may display It seems however to be otherwise with stronger   and livelier thinker who are still eager for life In that they side   AGAINST appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in   that they rank the credibility of their own body about a low a the   credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stand still and   thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession   to escape for what doe one at present believe in more firmly than   in one bodywho know if they are not really trying to win back   something which wa formerly an even securer possession something   of the old domain of the faith of former time perhaps the immortal   soul perhaps the old God in short idea by which they could live   better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by   modern idea There is DISTRUST of these modern idea in this mode   of looking at thing a disbelief in all that ha been constructed   yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety   and scorn which can no longer endure the BRICABRAC of idea of the   most varied origin such a socalled Positivism at present throw on   the market a disgust of the more refined taste at the villagefair   motleyness and patchiness of all these realityphilosophasters in whom   there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness Therein it   seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical antirealists and   knowledgemicroscopists of the present day their instinct which repels   them from MODERN reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde   bypath concern u The main thing about them is NOT that they wish   to go back but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom A little MORE   strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be OFFand   not back     11 It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to   divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on   German philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which   he set upon himself Kant wa first and foremost proud of his Table of   Categories with it in his hand he said This is the most difficult   thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics Let u   only understand this could be He wa proud of having DISCOVERED a   new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori Granting   that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid   flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and   on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible   somethingat all event new facultiesof which to be still   prouderBut let u reflect for a momentit is high time to do so   How are synthetic judgment a priori POSSIBLE Kant asks himselfand   what is really his answer BY MEANS OF A MEANS facultybut   unfortunately not in five word but so circumstantially imposingly   and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourish that   one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved   in such an answer People were beside themselves with delight over this   new faculty and the jubilation reached it climax when Kant further   discovered a moral faculty in manfor at that time Germans were still   moral not yet dabbling in the Politics of hard fact Then came   the honeymoon of German philosophy All the young theologian of the   Tubingen institution went immediately into the grovesall seeking for   faculty And what did they not findin that innocent rich and   still youthful period of the German spirit to which Romanticism the   malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish   between finding and inventing Above all a faculty for the   transcendental Schelling christened it intellectual intuition   and thereby gratified the most earnest longing of the naturally   piousinclined Germans One can do no greater wrong to the whole of   this exuberant and eccentric movement which wa really youthfulness   notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile   conception than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral   indignation Enough howeverthe world grew older and the dream   vanished A time came when people rubbed their forehead and they still   rub them today People had been dreaming and first and foremostold   Kant By mean of a mean facultyhe had said or at least meant to   say But is thatan answer An explanation Or is it not rather merely   a repetition of the question How doe opium induce sleep By mean of   a mean faculty namely the virtu dormitiva reply the doctor in   Moliere         Quia est in eo virtu dormitiva       Cujus est natura sensus assoupire     But such reply belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time   to replace the Kantian question How are synthetic judgment a PRIORI   possible by another question Why is belief in such judgment   necessaryin effect it is high time that we should understand   that such judgment must be believed to be true for the sake of the   preservation of creature like ourselves though they still might   naturally be false judgment Or more plainly spoken and roughly and   readilysynthetic judgment a priori should not be possible at all   we have no right to them in our mouth they are nothing but false   judgment Only of course the belief in their truth is necessary a   plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view   of life And finally to call to mind the enormous influence which   German philosophyI hope you understand it right to inverted comma   goosefeethas exercised throughout the whole of Europe there is   no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it thanks to   German philosophy it wa a delight to the noble idler the virtuous   the mystic the artiste the threefourths Christians and the   political obscurantist of all nation to find an antidote to the still   overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into   this in shortsensus assoupire     12 As regard materialistic atomism it is one of the bestrefuted   theory that have been advanced and in Europe there is now perhaps   no one in the learned world so unscholarly a to attach serious   signification to it except for convenient everyday use a an   abbreviation of the mean of expressionthanks chiefly to the Pole   Boscovich he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest   and most successful opponent of ocular evidence For while Copernicus   ha persuaded u to believe contrary to all the sens that the earth   doe NOT stand fast Boscovich ha taught u to abjure the belief in the   last thing that stood fast of the earththe belief in substance in   matter in the earthresiduum and particleatom it is the greatest   triumph over the sens that ha hitherto been gained on earth One   must however go still further and also declare war relentless war   to the knife against the atomistic requirement which still lead a   dangerous afterlife in place where no one suspect them like the more   celebrated metaphysical requirement one must also above all give   the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which   Christianity ha taught best and longest the SOULATOMISM Let it be   permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regard the   soul a something indestructible eternal indivisible a a monad   a an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science Between   ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby   and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypothesesas   happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalist who can hardly   touch on the soul without immediately losing it But the way is open   for new acceptation and refinement of the soulhypothesis and such   conception a mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity   and soul a social structure of the instinct and passion want   henceforth to have legitimate right in science In that the NEW   psychologist is about to put an end to the superstition which have   hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of   the soul he is really a it were thrusting himself into a new desert   and a new distrustit is possible that the older psychologist had a   merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he find   that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENTand who know   perhaps to DISCOVER the new     13 Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the   instinct of selfpreservation a the cardinal instinct of an organic   being A living thing seek above all to DISCHARGE it strengthlife   itself is WILL TO POWER selfpreservation is only one of the indirect   and most frequent RESULTS thereof In short here a everywhere else   let u beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principlesone of which   is the instinct of selfpreservation we owe it to Spinozas   inconsistency It is thus in effect that method ordains which must   be essentially economy of principle     14 It is perhaps just dawning on five or six mind that natural   philosophy is only a worldexposition and worldarrangement according   to u if I may say so and NOT a worldexplanation but in so far a   it is based on belief in the sens it is regarded a more and for a   long time to come must be regarded a morenamely a an explanation   It ha eye and finger of it own it ha ocular evidence and   palpableness of it own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and   CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastesin fact it   follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism   What is clear what is explained Only that which can be seen and   feltone must pursue every problem thus far Obversely however the   charm of the Platonic mode of thought which wa an ARISTOCRATIC mode   consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious senseevidenceperhaps   among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious sens than our   contemporary but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining   master of them and this by mean of pale cold grey conceptional   network which they threw over the motley whirl of the sensesthe   mob of the sens a Plato said In this overcoming of the world and   interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato there wa an ENJOYMENT   different from that which the physicist of today offer usand likewise   the Darwinists and antiteleologists among the physiological worker   with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest   possible blunder Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there   is also nothing more for men to dothat is certainly an imperative   different from the Platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right   imperative for a hardy laborious race of machinist and bridgebuilders   of the future who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform     15 To study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist on   the fact that the senseorgans are not phenomenon in the sense of the   idealistic philosophy a such they certainly could not be cause   Sensualism therefore at least a regulative hypothesis if not a   heuristic principle What And others say even that the external world   is the work of our organ But then our body a a part of this external   world would be the work of our organ But then our organ themselves   would be the work of our organ It seems to me that this is a   complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM if the conception CAUSA SUI is something   fundamentally absurd Consequently the external world is NOT the work   of our organ     16 There are still harmless selfobservers who believe that there are   immediate certainty for instance I think or a the superstition   of Schopenhauer put it I will a though cognition here got hold   of it object purely and simply a the thing in itself without any   falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the   object I would repeat it however a hundred time that immediate   certainty a well a absolute knowledge and the thing in itself   involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO we really ought to free ourselves   from the misleading significance of word The people on their part may   think that cognition is knowing all about thing but the philosopher   must say to himself When I analyze the process that is expressed in   the sentence I think I find a whole series of daring assertion the   argumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible   for instance that it is I who think that there must necessarily be   something that think that thinking is an activity and operation on the   part of a being who is thought of a a cause that there is an ego   and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by   thinkingthat I KNOW what thinking is For if I had not already decided   within myself what it is by what standard could I determine whether   that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling In   short the assertion I think assumes that I COMPARE my state at the   present moment with other state of myself which I know in order to   determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with   further knowledge it ha at any rate no immediate certainty for   meIn place of the immediate certainty in which the people may   believe in the special case the philosopher thus find a series of   metaphysical question presented to him veritable conscience question   of the intellect to wit Whence did I get the notion of thinking   Why do I believe in cause and effect What give me the right to speak   of an ego and even of an ego a cause and finally of an ego   a cause of thought He who venture to answer these metaphysical   question at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception like   the person who say I think and know that this at least is   true actual and certainwill encounter a smile and two note of   interrogation in a philosopher nowadays Sir the philosopher will   perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not   mistaken but why should it be the truth     17 With regard to the superstition of logician I shall never tire   of emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by   these credulous mindsnamely that a thought come when it wish   and not when I wish so that it is a PERVERSION of the fact of the   case to say that the subject I is the condition of the predicate   think ONE think but that this one is precisely the famous old   ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and   assuredly not an immediate certainty After all one ha even gone too   far with this one thinkseven the one contains an INTERPRETATION of   the process and doe not belong to the process itself One infers here   according to the usual grammatical formulaTo think is an activity   every activity requires an agency that is active consequently It   wa pretty much on the same line that the older atomism sought besides   the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out   of which it operatesthe atom More rigorous mind however learnt at   last to get along without this earthresiduum and perhaps some day we   shall accustom ourselves even from the logician point of view to   get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego ha   refined itself     18 It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is   refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle   mind It seems that the hundredtimesrefuted theory of the free will   owes it persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing   who feel himself strong enough to refute it     19 Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will a though it were   the bestknown thing in the world indeed Schopenhauer ha given u   to understand that the will alone is really known to u absolutely and   completely known without deduction or addition But it again and   again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what   philosopher are in the habit of doinghe seems to have adopted a   POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it Willing seems to me to be above   all something COMPLICATED something that is a unity only in nameand   it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which ha got   the mastery over the inadequate precaution of philosopher in all age   So let u for once be more cautious let u be unphilosophical let   u say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensation   namely the sensation of the condition AWAY FROM WHICH we go the   sensation of the condition TOWARDS WHICH we go the sensation of this   FROM and TOWARDS itself and then besides an accompanying muscular   sensation which even without our putting in motion arm and leg   commences it action by force of habit directly we will anything   Therefore just a sensation and indeed many kind of sensation are   to be recognized a ingredient of the will so in the second place   thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is   a ruling thoughtand let u not imagine it possible to sever this   thought from the willing a if the will would then remain over   In the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation and   thinking but it is above all an EMOTION and in fact the emotion of the   command That which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the   emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey I am free he   must obeythis consciousness is inherent in every will and equally   so the straining of the attention the straight look which fix itself   exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and   nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience   will be renderedand whatever else pertains to the position of the   commander A man who WILLS command something within himself which   render obedience or which he belief render obedience But now let   u notice what is the strangest thing about the willthis affair so   extremely complex for which the people have only one name Inasmuch a   in the given circumstance we are at the same time the commanding AND   the obeying party and a the obeying party we know the sensation of   constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually   commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch a on the other   hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive   ourselves about it by mean of the synthetic term I a whole series   of erroneous conclusion and consequently of false judgment about the   will itself ha become attached to the act of willingto such a degree   that he who will belief firmly that willing SUFFICES for action   Since in the majority of case there ha only been exercise of will   when the effect of the commandconsequently obedience and therefore   actionwas to be EXPECTED the APPEARANCE ha translated itself into   the sentiment a if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT in a word he who   will belief with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are   somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing   to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation   of power which accompanies all success Freedom of Willthat is the   expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising   volition who command and at the same time identifies himself with   the executor of the orderwho a such enjoys also the triumph over   obstacle but think within himself that it wa really his own will   that overcame them In this way the person exercising volition add the   feeling of delight of his successful executive instrument the useful   underwills or undersoulsindeed our body is but a social structure   composed of many soulsto his feeling of delight a commander LEFFET   CEST MOI what happens here is what happens in every wellconstructed   and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifies   itself with the success of the commonwealth In all willing it is   absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis a   already said of a social structure composed of many soul on which   account a philosopher should claim the right to include willingassuch   within the sphere of moralsregarded a the doctrine of the relation   of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifest itself     20 That the separate philosophical idea are not anything optional or   autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with   each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear   in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just a much to   a system a the collective member of the fauna of a Continentis   betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most   diverse philosopher always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme   of POSSIBLE philosophy Under an invisible spell they always revolve   once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they   may feel themselves with their critical or systematic will something   within them lead them something impels them in definite order the   one after the otherto wit the innate methodology and relationship   of their idea Their thinking is in fact far le a discovery than a   rerecognizing a remembering a return and a homecoming to a faroff   ancient commonhousehold of the soul out of which those idea formerly   grew philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order   The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian Greek and German   philosophizing is easily enough explained In fact where there is   affinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammarI mean   owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical   functionsit can not but be that everything is prepared at the outset   for a similar development and succession of philosophical system   just a the way seems barred against certain other possibility of   worldinterpretation It is highly probable that philosopher within the   domain of the UralAltaic language where the conception of the subject   is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be   found on path of thought different from those of the IndoGermans and   Mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical function is ultimately   also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuation and racial conditionsSo   much by way of rejecting Lockes superficiality with regard to the   origin of idea     21 The CAUSA SUI is the best selfcontradiction that ha yet been   conceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the   extravagant pride of man ha managed to entangle itself profoundly and   frightfully with this very folly The desire for freedom of will   in the superlative metaphysical sense such a still hold sway   unfortunately in the mind of the halfeducated the desire to bear   the entire and ultimate responsibility for one action oneself and   to absolve God the world ancestor chance and society therefrom   involves nothing le than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI and with   more than Munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the   hair out of the slough of nothingness If any one should find out in   this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free   will and put it out of his head altogether I beg of him to carry   his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the   contrary of this monstrous conception of free will I mean nonfree   will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect One   should not wrongly MATERIALISE cause and effect a the natural   philosopher do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at   present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which make   the cause press and push until it effect it end one should use   cause and effect only a pure CONCEPTIONS that is to say a   conventional fiction for the purpose of designation and mutual   understandingNOT for explanation In beinginitself there is   nothing of casualconnection of necessity or of psychological   nonfreedom there the effect doe NOT follow the cause there law   doe not obtain It is WE alone who have devised cause sequence   reciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motive   and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this symbolworld   a beinginitself with thing we act once more a we have always   actedMYTHOLOGICALLY The nonfree will is mythology in real life   it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK willsIt is almost always   a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in every   causalconnection and psychological necessity manifest something   of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and nonfreedom   it is suspicious to have such feelingsthe person betrays himself And   in general if I have observed correctly the nonfreedom of the will   is regarded a a problem from two entirely opposite standpoint but   always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner some will not give up their   responsibility their belief in THEMSELVES the personal right to   THEIR merit at any price the vain race belong to this class others   on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed   for anything and owing to an inward selfcontempt seek to GET OUT OF   THE BUSINESS no matter how The latter when they write book are   in the habit at present of taking the side of criminal a sort of   socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise And a a matter of   fact the fatalism of the weakwilled embellishes itself surprisingly   when it can pose a la religion de la souffrance humaine that is ITS   good taste     22 Let me be pardoned a an old philologist who can not desist from   the mischief of putting his finger on bad mode of interpretation but   Natures conformity to law of which you physicist talk so proudly   a thoughwhy it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad   philology It is no matter of fact no text but rather just a   naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which   you make abundant concession to the democratic instinct of the modern   soul Everywhere equality before the lawNature is not different in   that respect nor better than we a fine instance of secret motive   in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and   autocraticlikewise a second and more refined atheismis once more   disguised Ni dieu ni maitrethat also is what you want and   therefore Cheers for natural lawis it not so But a ha been   said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along   who with opposite intention and mode of interpretation could read   out of the same Nature and with regard to the same phenomenon just   the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claim   of poweran interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and   unconditionalness of all Will to Power before your eye that almost   every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem   unsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphoras being too   human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about   this world a you do namely that it ha a necessary and calculable   course NOT however because law obtain in it but because they are   absolutely LACKING and every power effect it ultimate consequence   every moment Granted that this also is only interpretationand you   will be eager enough to make this objectionwell so much the better     23 All psychology hitherto ha run aground on moral prejudice and   timidity it ha not dared to launch out into the depth In so far   a it is allowable to recognize in that which ha hitherto been written   evidence of that which ha hitherto been kept silent it seems a if   nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology a the Morphology   and DEVELOPMENTDOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER a I conceive of it   The power of moral prejudice ha penetrated deeply into the most   intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and   unprejudiced and ha obviously operated in an injurious obstructive   blinding and distorting manner A proper physiopsychology ha to   contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator   it ha the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal   conditionalness of the good and the bad impulse cause a   refined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manly   consciencestill more so a doctrine of the derivation of all good   impulse from bad one If however a person should regard even   the emotion of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness   a lifeconditioning emotion a factor which must be present   fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which   must therefore be further developed if life is to be further   developed he will suffer from such a view of thing a from   seasickness And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest   and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous   knowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reason why every one   should keep away from it who CAN do so On the other hand if one ha   once drifted hither with one bark well very good now let u set our   teeth firmly let u open our eye and keep our hand fast on the helm   We sail away right OVER morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the   remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thitherbut   what do WE matter Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal   itself to daring traveler and adventurer and the psychologist who   thus make a sacrificeit is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto   on the contrarywill at least be entitled to demand in return that   psychology shall once more be recognized a the queen of the science   for whose service and equipment the other science exist For psychology   is once more the path to the fundamental problem         CHAPTER II THE FREE SPIRIT       24 O sanctum simplicitas In what strange simplification and   falsification man life One can never cease wondering when once one ha   got eye for beholding this marvel How we have made everything around   u clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give   our sens a passport to everything superficial our thought a godlike   desire for wanton prank and wrong inferenceshow from the beginning   we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost   inconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartiness   and gaietyin order to enjoy life And only on this solidified   granitelike foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself   hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful   will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue Not a   it opposite butas it refinement It is to be hoped indeed that   LANGUAGE here a elsewhere will not get over it awkwardness and that   it will continue to talk of opposite where there are only degree   and many refinement of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the   incarnated Tartuffery of moral which now belongs to our unconquerable   flesh and blood will turn the word round in the mouth of u   discerning one Here and there we understand it and laugh at the way   in which precisely the best knowledge seek most to retain u in this   SIMPLIFIED thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitably   falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it love   error because a living itself it love life     25 After such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be   heard it appeal to the most serious mind Take care ye philosopher   and friend of knowledge and beware of martyrdom Of suffering for the   truth sake even in your own defense It spoil all the innocence   and fine neutrality of your conscience it make you headstrong against   objection and red rag it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when   in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even   worse consequence of enmity ye have at last to play your last card   a protector of truth upon earthas though the Truth were such an   innocent and incompetent creature a to require protector and you of   all people ye knight of the sorrowful countenance Messrs Loafers and   Cobwebspinners of the spirit Finally ye know sufficiently well that   it can not be of any consequence if YE just carry your point ye know   that hitherto no philosopher ha carried his point and that there might   be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark   which you place after your special word and favourite doctrine and   occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and   trumping game before accuser and lawcourt Rather go out of the way   Flee into concealment And have your mask and your rus that ye may   be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared And pray do nt forget   the garden the garden with golden trelliswork And have people around   you who are a a gardenor a music on the water at eventide when   already the day becomes a memory Choose the GOOD solitude the free   wanton lightsome solitude which also give you the right still to   remain good in any sense whatsoever How poisonous how crafty how bad   doe every long war make one which can not be waged openly by mean   of force How PERSONAL doe a long fear make one a long watching   of enemy of possible enemy These pariah of society these   longpursued badlypersecuted onesalso the compulsory recluse the   Spinozas or Giordano Brunosalways become in the end even under the   most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware   of it refined vengeanceseekers and poisonBrewers just lay bare   the foundation of Spinozas ethic and theology not to speak of   the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a   philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour ha left him The   martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth   force into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him   and if one ha hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity   with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous   desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a   martyr into a stageandtribunebawler Only that it is necessary   with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any   casemerely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the   continued proof that the long real tragedy IS AT AN END supposing that   every philosophy ha been a long tragedy in it origin     26 Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy   where he is FREE from the crowd the many the majoritywhere he may   forget men who are the rule a their exceptionexclusive only of   the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger   instinct a a discerner in the great and exceptional sense Whoever in   intercourse with men doe not occasionally glisten in all the green   and grey colour of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy   gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated taste   supposing however that he doe not voluntarily take all this burden   and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains   a I said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then   certain he wa not made he wa not predestined for knowledge For a   such he would one day have to say to himself The devil take my good   taste but the rule is more interesting than the exceptionthan   myself the exception And he would go DOWN and above all he would   go inside The long and serious study of the AVERAGE manand   consequently much disguise selfovercoming familiarity and bad   intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one   equalsthat constitutes a necessary part of the lifehistory of every   philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing   part If he is fortunate however a a favourite child of knowledge   should be he will meet with suitable auxiliary who will shorten and   lighten his task I mean socalled cynic those who simply recognize   the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the   same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness a to make them   talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSESsometimes they   wallow even in book a on their own dunghill Cynicism is the only   form in which base soul approach what is called honesty and the   higher man must open his ear to all the coarser or finer cynicism and   congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before   him or the scientific satyr speaks out There are even case where   enchantment mix with the disgustnamely where by a freak of nature   genius is bound to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape a in the   case of the Abbe Galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also   filthiest man of his centuryhe wa far profounder than Voltaire and   consequently also a good deal more silent It happens more frequently   a ha been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an ape body a   fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no mean   rare especially among doctor and moral physiologist And whenever   anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man   a a belly with two requirement and a head with one whenever any one   see seek and WANTS to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity   a the real and only motif of human action in short when any one   speaks badlyand not even illof man then ought the lover of   knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general   to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation For the   indignant man and he who perpetually tear and lacerates himself with   his own teeth or in place of himself the world God or society   may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and   selfsatisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary   more indifferent and le instructive case And no one is such a LIAR   a the indignant man     27 It is

language into another   is the TEMPO of it style which ha it basis in the character of the   race or to speak more physiologically in the average TEMPO of the   assimilation of it nutriment There are honestly meant translation   which a involuntary vulgarization are almost falsification of the   original merely because it lively and merry TEMPO which overleaps and   obviates all danger in word and

stiffness and elegance is no exception a a reflection of the good   old time to which it belongs and a an expression of German taste at a   time when there wa still a German taste which wa a rococotaste   in moribus et artibus Lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic   nature which understood much and wa versed in many thing he who wa   not the translator of Bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in   the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire and still more willingly among the   Roman comedywritersLessing loved also freespiritism in the TEMPO   and flight out of Germany But how could the German language even   in the prose of Lessing imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli who in his   Principe make u breathe the dry fine air of Florence and can not   help presenting the most serious event in a boisterous allegrissimo   perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he   venture to presentlong heavy difficult dangerous thought and   a TEMPO of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour Finally who   would venture on a German translation of Petronius who more than any   great musician hitherto wa a master of PRESTO in invention idea and   word What matter in the end about the swamp of the sick evil world   or of the ancient world when like him one ha the foot of a wind   the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which make   everything healthy by making everything RUN And with regard to   Aristophanesthat transfiguring complementary genius for whose   sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed provided one ha   understood in it full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and   transfiguration there is nothing that ha caused me to meditate more on   PLATOS secrecy and sphinxlike nature than the happily preserved petit   fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there wa found no   Bible nor anything Egyptian Pythagorean or Platonicbut a book of   Aristophanes How could even Plato have endured lifea Greek life which   he repudiatedwithout an Aristophanes     29 It is the business of the very few to be independent it is a   privilege of the strong And whoever attempt it even with the best   right but without being OBLIGED to do so prof that he is probably   not only strong but also daring beyond measure He enters into a   labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the danger which life in itself   already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see   how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal   by some minotaur of conscience Supposing such a one come to grief it   is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor   sympathize with it And he can not any longer go back He can not even go   back again to the sympathy of men     30 Our deepest insight mustand shouldappear a folly and under   certain circumstance a crime when they come unauthorizedly to   the ear of those who are not disposed and predestined for them The   exoteric and the esoteric a they were formerly distinguished by   philosophersamong the Indians a among the Greeks Persians and   Mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradation of rank and   NOT in equality and equal rightsare not so much in contradistinction   to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and   viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not   from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in   question view thing from below upwardswhile the esoteric class view   thing FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS There are height of the soul from which   tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically and if all the   woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether   the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy and   thus to a doubling of the woe That which serf the higher class of   men for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely   different and lower order of human being The virtue of the common   man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher it might be   possible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go   to ruin to acquire quality thereby alone for the sake of which he   would have to be honoured a a saint in the lower world into which he   had sunk There are book which have an inverse value for the soul and   the health according a the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the   higher and more powerful make use of them In the former case they are   dangerous disturbing unsettling book in the latter case they are   heraldcalls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery Books for the   general reader are always illsmelling book the odour of paltry people   cling to them Where the populace eat and drink and even where they   reverence it is accustomed to stink One should not go into church if   one wish to breathe PURE air     31 In our youthful year we still venerate and despise without the art   of NUANCE which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to do   hard penance for having fallen upon men and thing with Yea and Nay   Everything is so arranged that the worst of all taste THE TASTE FOR   THE UNCONDITIONAL is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learns   to introduce a little art into his sentiment and prefers to try   conclusion with the artificial a do the real artist of life The   angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no   peace until it ha suitably falsified men and thing to be able   to vent it passion upon them youth in itself even is something   falsifying and deceptive Later on when the young soul tortured by   continual disillusion finally turn suspiciously against itselfstill   ardent and savage even in it suspicion and remorse of conscience how   it upbraids itself how impatiently it tear itself how it revenge   itself for it long selfblinding a though it had been a voluntary   blindness In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one   sentiment one torture one enthusiasm with doubt one feel even the   good conscience to be a danger a if it were the selfconcealment and   lassitude of a more refined uprightness and above all one espouses   upon principle the cause AGAINST youthA decade later and one   comprehends that all this wa also stillyouth     32 Throughout the longest period of human historyone call it the   prehistoric periodthe value or nonvalue of an action wa inferred   from it CONSEQUENCES the action in itself wa not taken into   consideration any more than it origin but pretty much a in China at   present where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to   it parent the retrooperating power of success or failure wa what   induced men to think well or ill of an action Let u call this period   the PREMORAL period of mankind the imperative Know thyself wa   then still unknownIn the last ten thousand year on the other hand   on certain large portion of the earth one ha gradually got so far   that one no longer let the consequence of an action but it origin   decide with regard to it worth a great achievement a a whole an   important refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect   of the supremacy of aristocratic value and of the belief in origin   the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense a   the MORAL one the first attempt at selfknowledge is thereby   made Instead of the consequence the originwhat an inversion   of perspective And assuredly an inversion effected only after long   struggle and wavering To be sure an ominous new superstition a   peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely   thereby the origin of an action wa interpreted in the most definite   sense possible a origin out of an INTENTION people were agreed in the   belief that the value of an action lay in the value of it intention   The intention a the sole origin and antecedent history of an action   under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been   bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the   present dayIs it not possible however that the necessity may now   have arisen of again making up our mind with regard to the reversing   and fundamental shifting of value owing to a new selfconsciousness   and acuteness in manis it not possible that we may be standing on   the threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguished   negatively a ULTRAMORAL nowadays when at least among u immoralists   the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lie precisely   in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL and that all it intentionalness all   that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to it surface or   skinwhich like every skin betrays something but CONCEALS still   more In short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom   which first requires an explanationa sign moreover which ha too   many interpretation and consequently hardly any meaning in itself   alone that morality in the sense in which it ha been understood   hitherto a intentionmorality ha been a prejudice perhaps a   prematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rank   a astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be   surmounted The surmounting of morality in a certain sense even the   selfmounting of moralitylet that be the name for the longsecret   labour which ha been reserved for the most refined the most upright   and also the most wicked conscience of today a the living touchstone   of the soul     33 It can not be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice for   one neighbour and all selfrenunciationmorality must be mercilessly   called to account and brought to judgment just a the aesthetic   of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art   nowadays seek insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience   There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiment for others   and NOT for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here   and for one asking promptly Are they not perhapsDECEPTIONSThat   they PLEASEhim who ha them and him who enjoys their fruit and also   the mere spectatorthat is still no argument in their FAVOUR but just   call for caution Let u therefore be cautious     34 At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays   seen from every position the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we   think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eye can light   upon we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure u into   surmise concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of thing   He however who make thinking itself and consequently the spirit   responsible for the falseness of the worldan honourable exit which   every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avail himself ofhe   who regard this world including space time form and movement a   falsely DEDUCED would have at least good reason in the end to become   distrustful also of all thinking ha it not hitherto been playing upon   u the worst of scurvy trick and what guarantee would it give that   it would not continue to do what it ha always been doing In all   seriousness the innocence of thinker ha something touching and   respectinspiring in it which even nowadays permit them to wait upon   consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answer   for example whether it be real or not and why it keep the outer   world so resolutely at a distance and other question of the same   description The belief in immediate certainty is a MORAL NAIVETE   which doe honour to u philosopher butwe have now to cease being   MERELY moral men Apart from morality such belief is a folly which   doe little honour to u If in middleclass life an everready distrust   is regarded a the sign of a bad character and consequently a an   imprudence here among u beyond the middleclass world and it Yeas   and Nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the   philosopher ha at length a RIGHT to bad character a the being who   ha hitherto been most befooled on earthhe is now under OBLIGATION   to distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of   suspicionForgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of   expression for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate   differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and I keep at   least a couple of poke in the rib ready for the blind rage with which   philosopher struggle against being deceived Why NOT It is nothing   more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it   is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world So much must be   conceded there could have been no life at all except upon the basis   of perspective estimate and semblance and if with the virtuous   enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosopher one wished to do away   altogether with the seeming worldwell granted that YOU could do   thatat least nothing of your truth would thereby remain Indeed   what is it that force u in general to the supposition that there is an   essential opposition of true and false Is it not enough to suppose   degree of seemingness and a it were lighter and darker shade and   tone of semblancedifferent valeurs a the painter say Why might   not the world WHICH CONCERNS USbe a fiction And to any one who   suggested But to a fiction belongs an originatormight it not be   bluntly replied WHY May not this belong also belong to the fiction   Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the   subject just a towards the predicate and object Might not the   philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar All respect   to governess but is it not time that philosophy should renounce   governessfaith     35 O Voltaire O humanity O idiocy There is something ticklish in   the truth and in the SEARCH for the truth and if man go about it   too humanelyil ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bienI wager he   find nothing     36 Supposing that nothing else is given a real but our world of   desire and passion that we can not sink or rise to any other reality   but just that of our impulsesfor thinking is only a relation of these   impulse to one anotherare we not permitted to make the attempt and   to ask the question whether this which is given doe not SUFFICE by   mean of our counterpart for the understanding even of the socalled   mechanical or material world I do not mean a an illusion a   semblance a representation in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian   sense but a possessing the same degree of reality a our emotion   themselvesas a more primitive form of the world of emotion in   which everything still lie locked in a mighty unity which afterwards   branch off and develops itself in organic process naturally also   refines and debilitatesas a kind of instinctive life in which all   organic function including selfregulation assimilation nutrition   secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with   one anotheras a PRIMARY FORM of lifeIn the end it is not only   permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of   LOGICAL METHOD Not to assume several kind of causality so long a   the attempt to get along with a single one ha not been pushed to it   furthest extent to absurdity if I may be allowed to say so that is   a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadaysit follows   from it definition a mathematician say The question is ultimately   whether we really recognize the will a OPERATING whether we believe in   the causality of the will if we do soand fundamentally our belief IN   THIS is just our belief in causality itselfwe MUST make the attempt   to posit hypothetically the causality of the will a the only causality   Will can naturally only operate on willand not on matter not   on nerve for instance in short the hypothesis must be   hazarded whether will doe not operate on will wherever effect   are recognizedand whether all mechanical action inasmuch a a power   operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will   Granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive   life a the development and ramification of one fundamental form of   willnamely the Will to Power a my thesis put it granted that all   organic function could be traced back to this Will to Power and that   the solution of the problem of generation and nutritionit is one   problemcould also be found therein one would thus have acquired the   right to define ALL active force unequivocally a WILL TO POWER The   world seen from within the world defined and designated according to   it intelligible characterit would simply be Will to Power and   nothing else     37 What Does not that mean in popular language God is disproved but   not the devilOn the contrary On the contrary my friend And who   the devil also compels you to speak popularly     38 As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern time with   the French Revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous when   judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary   spectator of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own   indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately UNTIL THE TEXT HAS   DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION so a noble posterity might once   more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make   ITS aspect endurableOr rather ha not this already happened Have   not we ourselves beenthat noble posterity And in so far a we now   comprehend this is it notthereby already past     39 Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine a true merely because   it make people happy or virtuousexcepting perhaps the amiable   Idealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful   and let all kind of motley coarse and goodnatured desirability   swim about promiscuously in their pond Happiness and virtue are no   argument It is willingly forgotten however even on the part of   thoughtful mind that to make unhappy and to make bad are just a   little counterargument A thing could be TRUE although it were in   the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental   constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full   knowledge of itso that the strength of a mind might be measured by   the amount of truth it could endureor to speak more plainly by the   extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped   and falsified But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain   PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably   situated and have a greater likelihood of success not to speak of the   wicked who are happya specie about whom moralist are silent Perhaps   severity and craft are more favourable condition for the development of   strong independent spirit and philosopher than the gentle refined   yielding goodnature and habit of taking thing easily which are   prized and rightly prized in a learned man Presupposing always   to begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to the   philosopher who writes book or even introduces HIS philosophy into   booksStendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the   freespirited philosopher which for the sake of German taste I will   not omit to underlinefor it is OPPOSED to German taste Pour etre   bon philosophe say this last great psychologist il faut etre sec   clair sans illusion Un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du   caractere requis pour faire de decouvertes en philosophie cestadire   pour voir clair dans ce qui est     40 Everything that is profound love the mask the profoundest thing   have a hatred even of figure and likeness Should not the CONTRARY only   be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in A question   worth askingit would be strange if some mystic ha not already   ventured on the same kind of thing There are proceeding of such a   delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness   and make them unrecognizable there are action of love and of an   extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take   a stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his   recollection Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in   order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret   shame is inventive They are not the worst thing of which one is   most ashamed there is not only deceit behind a maskthere is so much   goodness in craft I could imagine that a man with something costly and   fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like   an old green heavilyhooped winecask the refinement of his shame   requiring it to be so A man who ha depth in his shame meet his   destiny and his delicate decision upon path which few ever reach   and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate   friend may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their   eye and equally so his regained security Such a hidden nature   which instinctively employ speech for silence and concealment and is   inexhaustible in evasion of communication DESIRES and insists that a   mask of himself shall occupy his place in the heart and head of his   friend and supposing he doe not desire it his eye will some day be   opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him thereand   that it is well to be so Every profound spirit need a mask nay more   around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing to   the constantly false that is to say SUPERFICIAL interpretation   of every word he utters every step he take every sign of life he   manifest     41 One must subject oneself to one own test that one is destined   for independence and command and do so at the right time One must not   avoid one test although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous   game one can play and are in the end test made only before ourselves   and before no other judge Not to cleave to any person be it even the   dearestevery person is a prison and also a recess Not to cleave to   a fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitousit is even   le difficult to detach one heart from a victorious fatherland Not   to cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiar   torture and helplessness chance ha given u an insight Not to cleave   to a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discovery   apparently specially reserved for u Not to cleave to one own   liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which   always fly further aloft in order always to see more under itthe   danger of the flier Not to cleave to our own virtue nor become a   a whole a victim to any of our specialty to our hospitality for   instance which is the danger of danger for highly developed   and wealthy soul who deal prodigally almost indifferently with   themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes   a vice One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELFthe best test of   independence     42 A new order of philosopher is appearing I shall venture to baptize   them by a name not without danger As far a I understand them a far   a they allow themselves to be understoodfor it is their nature to   WISH to remain something of a puzzlethese philosopher of the   future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated a   tempter This name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be   preferred a temptation     43 Will they be new friend of truth these coming philosopher Very   probably for all philosopher hitherto have loved their truth But   assuredly they will not be dogmatist It must be contrary to their   pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still   be truth for every onethat which ha hitherto been the secret wish   and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic effort My opinion is MY opinion   another person ha not easily a right to itsuch a philosopher of the   future will say perhaps One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to   agree with many people Good is no longer good when one neighbour   take it into his mouth And how could there be a common good The   expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of   small value In the end thing must be a they are and have always   beenthe great thing remain for the great the abyss for the   profound the delicacy and thrill for the refined and to sum up   shortly everything rare for the rare       44 Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free VERY   free spirit these philosopher of the futureas certainly also they   will not be merely free spirit but something more higher greater   and fundamentally different which doe not wish to be misunderstood and   mistaken But while I say this I feel under OBLIGATION almost a much   to them a to ourselves we free spirit who are their herald and   forerunner to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old   prejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog ha too long made the   conception of free spirit obscure In every country of Europe and the   same in America there is at present something which make an abuse of   this name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirit   who desire almost the opposite of what our intention and instinct   promptnot to mention that in respect to the NEW philosopher who are   appearing they must still more be closed window and bolted door   Briefly and regrettably they belong to the LEVELLERS these wrongly   named free spiritsas glibtongued and scribefingered slave of   the democratic taste and it modern idea all of them men without   solitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellow to whom   neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only they   are not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in their   innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and   failure in the old form in which society ha hitherto existeda notion   which happily inverts the truth entirely What they would fain attain   with all their strength is the universal greenmeadow happiness of the   herd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of life   for every one their two most frequently chanted song and doctrine   are called Equality of Rights and Sympathy with All Sufferersand   suffering itself is looked upon by them a something which must be   DONE AWAY WITH We opposite one however who have opened our eye and   conscience to the question how and where the plant man ha hitherto   grown most vigorously believe that this ha always taken place under   the opposite condition that for this end the dangerousness of his   situation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty and   dissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daring   under long oppression and compulsion and his Will to Life had to be   increased to the unconditioned Will to Powerwe believe that severity   violence slavery danger in the street and in the heart secrecy   stoicism tempter art and devilry of every kindthat everything   wicked terrible tyrannical predatory and serpentine in man serf   a well for the elevation of the human specie a it oppositewe do   not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH and in any case we   find ourselves here both with our speech and our silence at the OTHER   extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability a their   antipode perhaps What wonder that we free spirit are not exactly   the most communicative spirit that we do not wish to betray in every   respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from and WHERE perhaps it will   then be driven And a to the import of the dangerous formula Beyond   Good and Evil with which we at least avoid confusion we ARE something   else than librespenseurs liben pensatori freethinker   and whatever these honest advocate of modern idea like to call   themselves Having been at

hitherto attained the height depth and distance of these   experience the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME   and it still unexhausted possibility this is the preordained   huntingdomain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt But   how often must he say despairingly to himself A single individual   ala only a single individual and this great forest this virgin   forest So he would like to have some hundred of hunting assistant   and fine trained hound that he could send into the history of the   human soul to drive HIS game together In vain again and again he   experience profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to find   assistant and dog for all the thing that directly excite his   curiosity The evil of sending scholar into new and dangerous   huntingdomains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense   are required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the BIG   hunt and also the great danger commencesit is precisely then that   they lose their keen eye and nose In order for instance to divine and   determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE   ha hitherto had in the soul of homines religiosi a person would   perhaps himself have to posse a profound a bruised a immense an   experience a the intellectual conscience of Pascal and then he would   still require that widespread heaven of clear wicked spirituality   which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively   formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiencesBut who   could do me this service And who would have time to wait for such   servantsthey evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at   all time Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know   something which mean that one ha MUCH to doBut a curiosity like   mine is once for all the most agreeable of vicespardon me I mean to   say that the love of truth ha it reward in heaven and already upon   earth     46 Faith such a early Christianity desired and not infrequently   achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly freespirited world   which had century of struggle between philosophical school behind   it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which   the Imperium Romanum gavethis faith is NOT that sincere austere   slavefaith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell or some other   northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and   Christianity it is much rather the faith of Pascal which resembles in   a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reasona tough longlived   wormlike reason which is not to be slain at once and with a single   blow The Christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrifice   of all freedom all pride all selfconfidence of spirit it is at   the same time subjection selfderision and selfmutilation There is   cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to a   tender manysided and very fastidious conscience it take for granted   that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL that all the   past and all the habit of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum in   the form of which faith come to it Modern men with their obtuseness   a regard all Christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for the   terribly superlative conception which wa implied to an antique taste by   the paradox of the formula God on the Cross Hitherto there had never   and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so   dreadful questioning and questionable a this formula it promised a   transvaluation of all ancient valuesIt wa the Orient the PROFOUND   Orient it wa the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and it   noble lightminded toleration on the Roman Catholicism of nonfaith   and it wa always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the   halfstoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith   which made the slave indignant at their master and revolt against   them Enlightenment cause revolt for the slave desire the   unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in moral   he love a he hate without NUANCE to the very depth to the point   of pain to the point of sicknesshis many HIDDEN suffering make   him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering The   skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of   aristocratic morality wa not the least of the cause also of the   last great slaveinsurrection which began with the French Revolution     47 Wherever the religious neurosis ha appeared on the earth so far   we find it connected with three dangerous prescription a to regimen   solitude fasting and sexual abstinencebut without it being possible   to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or IF   any relation at all of cause and effect exists there This latter doubt   is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptom among   savage a well a among civilized people is the most sudden and   excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into   penitential paroxysm worldrenunciation and willrenunciation both   symptom perhaps explainable a disguised epilepsy But nowhere is it   MORE obligatory to put aside explanation around no other type ha there   grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems to   have been more interesting to men and even to philosophersperhaps it   is time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution or   better still to look AWAY TO GO AWAYYet in the background of the   most recent philosophy that of Schopenhauer we find almost a the   problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious   crisis and awakening How is the negation of will POSSIBLE how is the   saint possiblethat seems to have been the very question with which   Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher And thus it wa a   genuine Schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent   perhaps also his last a far a Germany is concerned namely Richard   Wagner should bring his own lifework to an end just here and should   finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage a Kundry   type vecu and a it loved and lived at the very time that the   maddoctors in almost all European country had an opportunity to study   the type close at hand wherever the religious neurosisor a I call   it the religious moodmade it latest epidemical outbreak and   display a the Salvation ArmyIf it be a question however a to   what ha been so extremely interesting to men of all sort in all age   and even to philosopher in the whole phenomenon of the saint it   is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous thereinnamely the   immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES of state of the soul regarded a   morally antithetical it wa believed here to be selfevident that   a bad man wa all at once turned into a saint a good man The   hitherto existing psychology wa wrecked at this point is it not   possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed   itself under the dominion of moral because it BELIEVED in opposition   of moral value and saw read and INTERPRETED these opposition   into the text and fact of the case What Miracle only an error of   interpretation A lack of philology     48 It seems that the Latin race are far more deeply attached to their   Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally and   that consequently unbelief in Catholic country mean something quite   different from what it doe among Protestantsnamely a sort of revolt   against the spirit of the race while with u it is rather a return to   the spirit or nonspirit of the race     We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous race even   a regard our talent for religionwe have POOR talent for it One   may make an exception in the case of the Celts who have theretofore   furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North the   Christian ideal blossomed forth in France a much a ever the pale sun   of the north would allow it How strangely pious for our taste are still   these later French skeptic whenever there is any Celtic blood in their   origin How Catholic how unGerman doe Auguste Comtes Sociology   seem to u with the Roman logic of it instinct How Jesuitical that   amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal SainteBeuve in spite of all   his hostility to Jesuits And even Ernest Renan how inaccessible to   u Northerners doe the language of such a Renan appear in whom   every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throw his refined   voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off it balance Let u repeat   after him these fine sentencesand what wickedness and haughtiness is   immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably le beautiful but   harder soul that is to say in our more German soulsDISONS DONC   HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT

religious life of the ancient   Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours   forthit is a very superior kind of man who take SUCH an attitude   towards nature and lifeLater on when the populace got the upper hand   in Greece FEAR became rampant also in religion and Christianity wa   preparing itself     50 The passion for God there are churlish honesthearted and   importunate kind of it like that of Lutherthe whole of Protestantism   lack the southern DELICATEZZA There is an Oriental exaltation of the   mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave a   in the case of St Augustine for instance who lack in an offensive   manner all nobility in bearing and desire There is a feminine   tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs   for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA a in the case of Madame de Guyon In   many case it appears curiously enough a the disguise of a girl   or youth puberty here and there even a the hysteria of an old maid   also a her last ambition The Church ha frequently canonized the woman   in such a case     51 The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before   the saint a the enigma of selfsubjugation and utter voluntary   privationwhy did they thus bow They divined in himand a it were   behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearancethe   superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation the   strength of will in which they recognized their own strength and   love of power and knew how to honour it they honoured something   in themselves when they honoured the saint In addition to this the   contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion such an   enormity of selfnegation and antinaturalness will not have been   coveted for nothingthey have said inquiringly There is perhaps a   reason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic might   wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutor and   visitor In a word the mighty one of the world learned to have a new   fear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconquered   enemyit wa the Will to Power which obliged them to halt before the   saint They had to question him     52 In the Jewish Old Testament the book of divine justice there are   men thing and saying on such an immense scale that Greek and Indian   literature ha nothing to compare with it One stand with fear and   reverence before those stupendous remains of what man wa formerly and   one ha sad thought about old Asia and it little outpushed peninsula   Europe which would like by all mean to figure before Asia a the   Progress of Mankind To be sure he who is himself only a slender   tame houseanimal and know only the want of a houseanimal like   our cultured people of today including the Christians of cultured   Christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruinsthe   taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to great and   small perhaps he will find that the New Testament the book of grace   still appeal more to his heart there is much of the odour of the   genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it To have bound   up this New Testament a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect along   with the Old Testament into one book a the Bible a The Book in   Itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the Spirit   which literary Europe ha upon it conscience     53 Why Atheism nowadays The father in God is thoroughly refuted   equally so the judge the rewarder Also his free will he doe   not hearand even if he did he would not know how to help The worst   is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he   uncertainThis is what I have made out by questioning and listening   at a variety of conversation to be the cause of the decline of   European theism it appears to me that though the religious instinct is   in vigorous growthit reject the theistic satisfaction with profound   distrust     54 What doe all modern philosophy mainly do Since Descartesand   indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedurean   ATTENTAT ha been made on the part of all philosopher on the old   conception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subject   and predicate conceptionthat is to say an ATTENTAT on the   fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine Modern philosophy   a epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly ANTICHRISTIAN   although for keener ear be it said by no mean antireligious   Formerly in effect one believed in the soul a one believed in   grammar and the grammatical subject one said I is the condition   think is the predicate and is conditionedto think is an activity for   which one MUST suppose a subject a cause The attempt wa then made   with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out   of this netto see if the opposite wa not perhaps true think the   condition and I the conditioned I therefore only a synthesis   which ha been MADE by thinking itself KANT really wished to prove   that starting from the subject the subject could not be provednor   the object either the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the   subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange   to himthe thought which once had an immense power on earth a the   Vedanta philosophy     55 There is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many round but   three of these are the most important Once on a time men sacrificed   human being to their God and perhaps just those they loved the   bestto this category belong the firstling sacrifice of all primitive   religion and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the   MithraGrotto on the Island of Capri that most terrible of all Roman   anachronism Then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificed   to their God the strongest instinct they possessed their nature   THIS festal joy shine in the cruel glance of ascetic and   antinatural fanatic Finally what still remained to be sacrificed   Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything   comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmony in   future blessedness and justice Was it not necessary to sacrifice God   himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity   gravity fate nothingness To sacrifice God for nothingnessthis   paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty ha been reserved for the   rising generation we all know something thereof already     56 Whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire ha long   endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it   from the halfChristian halfGerman narrowness and stupidity in which   it ha finally presented itself to this century namely in the form of   Schopenhauers philosophy whoever with an Asiatic and superAsiatic   eye ha actually looked inside and into the most worldrenouncing of   all possible mode of thoughtbeyond good and evil and no longer   like Buddha and Schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of   moralitywhoever ha done this ha perhaps just thereby without   really desiring it opened his eye to behold the opposite ideal the   ideal of the most worldapproving exuberant and vivacious man who ha   not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which wa and   is but wish to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS for all eternity   insatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the whole   piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires   the playand make it necessary because he always requires   himself anewand make himself necessaryWhat And this would not   becirculus vitiosus deus     57 The distance and a it were the space around man grows with the   strength of his intellectual vision and insight his world becomes   profounder new star new enigma and notion are ever coming into   view Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye ha exercised   it acuteness and profundity ha just been an occasion for it exercise   something of a game something for child and childish mind Perhaps   the most solemn conception that have caused the most fighting and   suffering the conception God and sin will one day seem to u of   no more importance than a child plaything or a child pain seems to   an old manand perhaps another plaything and another pain will then   be necessary once more for the old manalways childish enough an   eternal child     58 Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness or   semiidleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for it   favourite microscopic labour of selfexamination and for it soft   placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the   coming of God I mean the idleness with a good conscience the   idleness of olden time and of blood to which the aristocratic   sentiment that work is DISHONOURINGthat it vulgarizes body and   soulis not quite unfamiliar And that consequently the modern noisy   timeengrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates   and prepares for unbelief more than anything else Among these for   instance who are at present living apart from religion in Germany I   find freethinker of diversified specie and origin but above all   a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation   ha dissolved the religious instinct so that they no longer know what   purpose religion serve and only note their existence in the world   with a kind of dull astonishment They feel themselves already fully   occupied these good people be it by their business or by their   pleasure not to mention the Fatherland and the newspaper and   their family duty it seems that they have no time whatever left   for religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is a   question of a new business or a new pleasurefor it is impossible they   say to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoil   their temper They are by no mean enemy of religious custom   should certain circumstance State affair perhaps require their   participation in such custom they do what is required a so many   thing are donewith a patient and unassuming seriousness and without   much curiosity or discomfortthey live too much apart and outside   to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matter Among   those indifferent person may be reckoned nowadays the majority of   German Protestants of the middle class especially in the great   laborious centre of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious   scholar and the entire University personnel with the exception of   the theologian whose existence and possibility there always give   psychologist new and more subtle puzzle to solve On the part of   pious or merely churchgoing people there is seldom any idea of HOW   MUCH goodwill one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for a   German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole   profession and a I have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to   which he is compelled by his modern conscience incline him to a   lofty and almost charitable serenity a regard religion with which is   occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit   which he take for granted wherever any one still professes to belong   to the Church It is only with the help of history NOT through his own   personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing   himself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deference   in presence of religion but even when his sentiment have reached the   stage of gratitude towards them he ha not personally advanced one   step nearer to that which still maintains itself a Church or a piety   perhaps even the contrary The practical indifference to religious   matter in the midst of which he ha been born and brought up usually   sublimate itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which   shuns contact with religious men and thing and it may be just the   depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompt him to avoid the   delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with itEvery age ha   it own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other age   may envy it and how much naiveteadorable childlike and boundlessly   foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in   his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the   unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treat the   religious man a a lower and le valuable type beyond before and   ABOVE which he himself ha developedhe the little arrogant dwarf   and mobman the sedulously alert headandhand drudge of idea of   modern idea     59 Whoever ha seen deeply into the world ha doubtless divined what   wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial It is their   preservative instinct which teach them to be flighty lightsome and   false Here and there one find a passionate and exaggerated adoration   of pure form in philosopher a well a in artist it is not to be   doubted that whoever ha NEED of the cult of the superficial to that   extent ha at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it   Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt   child the born artist who find the enjoyment of life only in trying   to FALSIFY it image a if taking wearisome revenge on it one might   guess to what degree life ha disgusted them by the extent to which   they wish to see it image falsified attenuated ultrified and   deifiedone might reckon the homines religiosi among the artist a   their HIGHEST rank It is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable   pessimism which compels whole century to fasten their teeth into a   religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which   divine that truth might be attained TOO soon before man ha become   strong enough hard enough artist enough Piety the Life in God   regarded in this light would appear a the most elaborate and   ultimate product of the FEAR of truth a artistadoration   and artistintoxication in presence of the most logical of all   falsification a the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at   any price Perhaps there ha hitherto been no more effective mean of   beautifying man than piety by mean of it man can become so artful so   superficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longer   offends     60 To love mankind FOR GODS SAKEthis ha so far been the noblest and   remotest sentiment to which mankind ha attained That love to mankind   without any redeeming intention in the background is only an ADDITIONAL   folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love ha first to   get it proportion it delicacy it gram of salt and sprinkling   of ambergris from a higher inclinationwhoever first perceived   and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered a it   attempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time be   holy and respected a the man who ha so far flown highest and gone   astray in the finest fashion     61 The philosopher a WE free spirit understand himas the man of   the greatest responsibility who ha the conscience for the general   development of mankindwill use religion for his disciplining and   educating work just a he will use the contemporary political   and economic condition The selecting and disciplining   influencedestructive a well a creative and fashioningwhich can be   exercised by mean of religion is manifold and varied according to the   sort of people placed under it spell and protection For those who are   strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the   judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion is   an additional mean for overcoming resistance in the exercise of   authorityas a bond which bind ruler and subject in common   betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter   their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience And in the   case of the unique nature of noble origin if by virtue of superior   spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative   life reserving to themselves only the more refined form of government   over chosen disciple or member of an order religion itself may   be used a a mean for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of   managing GROSSER affair and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE   filth of all political agitation The Brahmins for instance understood   this fact With the help of a religious organization they secured to   themselves the power of nominating king for the people while their   sentiment prompted them to keep apart and outside a men with a higher   and superregal mission At the same time religion give inducement and   opportunity to some of the subject to qualify themselves for future   ruling and commanding the slowly ascending rank and class in which   through fortunate marriage custom volitional power and delight in   selfcontrol are on the increase To them religion offer sufficient   incentive and temptation to aspire to higher intellectuality and to   experience the sentiment of authoritative selfcontrol of silence and   of solitude Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable mean of   educating and ennobling a race which seek to rise above it hereditary   baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy And finally to   ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service and   general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion give   invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heart   ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy   with something of transfiguration and embellishment something of   justification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all   the semianimal poverty of their soul Religion together with the   religious significance of life shed sunshine over such perpetually   harassed men and make even their own aspect endurable to them it   operates upon them a the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon   sufferer of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manner   almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT and in the end even hallowing and   vindicating it There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity   and Buddhism a their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate   themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of thing and thereby   to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it   difficult enough to livethis very difficulty being necessary     62 To be sureto make also the bad counterreckoning against such   religion and to bring to light their secret dangersthe cost is   always excessive and terrible when religion do NOT operate a an   educational and disciplinary medium in the hand of the philosopher but   rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY when they wish to be the final end   and not a mean along with other mean Among men a among all other   animal there is a surplus of defective diseased degenerating   infirm and necessarily suffering individual the successful case   among men also are always the exception and in view of the fact that   man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT the rare   exception But worse still The higher the type a man represents the   greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED the accidental the   law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifest   itself most terribly in it destructive effect on the higher order of   men the condition of whose life are delicate diverse and difficult   to determine What then is the attitude of the two greatest religion   abovementioned to the SURPLUS of failure in life They endeavour   to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved in fact a the   religion FOR SUFFERERS they take the part of these upon principle   they are always in favour of those who suffer from life a from a   disease and they would fain treat every other experience of life a   false and impossible However highly we may esteem this indulgent and   preservative care inasmuch a in applying to others it ha applied   and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of   man the hitherto PARAMOUNT religionsto give a general appreciation   of themare among the principal cause which have kept the type of   man upon a lower levelthey have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD   HAVE PERISHED One ha to thank them for invaluable service and who is   sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation   of all that the spiritual men of Christianity have done for Europe   hitherto But when they had given comfort to the sufferer courage to   the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless   and when they had allured from society into convent and spiritual   penitentiary the brokenhearted and distracted what else had they   to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good   conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which   mean in deed and in truth to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE   EUROPEAN RACE To REVERSE all estimate of valueTHAT is what they   had to do And to shatter the strong to spoil great hope to cast   suspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomous   manly conquering and imperiousall instinct which are natural to the   highest and most successful type of maninto uncertainty distress   of conscience and selfdestruction forsooth to invert all love of the   earthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth and   earthly thingsTHAT is the task the Church imposed on itself and   wa obliged to impose until according to it standard of value   unworldliness unsensuousness and higher man fused into one   sentiment If one could observe the strangely painful equally coarse   and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and   impartial eye of an Epicurean god I should think one would never cease   marvelling and laughing doe it not actually seem that some single will   ha ruled over Europe for eighteen century in order to make a SUBLIME   ABORTION of man He however who with opposite requirement no longer   Epicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach this   almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind a exemplified in   the European Christian Pascal for instance would he not have to   cry aloud with rage pity and horror Oh you bungler presumptuous   pitiful bungler what have you done Was that a work for your hand   How you have

reality they honour and love only themselves or their own ideal to   express it more agreeably Thus man wish woman to be peaceable but   in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable like the cat however

diverse sensitive and refined a the Science of Morals   belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarsefingeredan   interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious   in the very person of a moralist Indeed the expression Science   of Morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too   presumptuous and counter to GOOD tastewhich is always a foretaste of   more modest expression One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT   is still necessary here for a long time WHAT is alone proper for the   present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey   and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiment of worth   and distinction of worth which live grow propagate and perishand   perhaps attempt to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common   form of these living crystallizationsas preparation for a THEORY OF   TYPES of morality To be sure people have not hitherto been so modest   All the philosopher with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness   demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and   ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality a a science   they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to moralityand every philosopher hitherto   ha believed that he ha given it a basis morality itself however ha   been regarded a something given How far from their awkward pride   wa the seemingly insignificant problemleft in dust and decayof a   description of form of morality notwithstanding that the finest hand   and sens could hardly be fine enough for it It wa precisely owing to   moral philosopher knowing the moral fact imperfectly in an arbitrary   epitome or an accidental abridgementperhaps a the morality of   their environment their position their church their Zeitgeist their   climate and zoneit wa precisely because they were badly instructed   with regard to nation era and past age and were by no mean eager   to know about these matter that they did not even come in sight of the   real problem of moralsproblems which only disclose themselves by   a comparison of MANY kind of morality In every Science of Morals   hitherto strange a it may sound the problem of morality itself   ha been OMITTED there ha been no suspicion that there wa anything   problematic there That which philosopher called giving a basis to   morality and endeavoured to realize ha when seen in a right light   proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality a new   mean of it EXPRESSION consequently just a matteroffact within the   sphere of a definite morality yea in it ultimate motive a sort of   denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in questionand   in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and   vivisecting of this very faith Hear for instance with what   innocencealmost worthy of honourSchopenhauer represents his own   task and draw your conclusion concerning the scientificness of a   Science whose latest master still talk in the strain of child and   old wife The principle he say page 136 of the Grundprobleme der   Ethik Footnote Pages 5455 of Schopenhauers Basis of Morality   translated by Arthur B Bullock MA 1903 the axiom about the   purport of which all moralist are PRACTICALLY agreed neminem laede   immo omnes quantum potes juvais REALLY the proposition which all moral   teacher strive to establish   the REAL basis of ethic which   ha been sought like the philosopher stone for centuriesThe   difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be   greatit is well known that Schopenhauer also wa unsuccessful in his   effort and whoever ha thoroughly realized how absurdly false and   sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is Will   to Power may be reminded that Schopenhauer although a pessimist   ACTUALLYplayed the flute daily after dinner one may read about   the matter in his biography A question by the way a pessimist a   repudiator of God and of the world who MAKES A HALT at moralitywho   assent to morality and play the flute to laedeneminem moral what   Is that reallya pessimist     187 Apart from the value of such assertion a there is a categorical   imperative in u one can always ask What doe such an assertion   indicate about him who make it There are system of moral which are   meant to justify their author in the eye of other people other system   of moral are meant to tranquilize him and make him selfsatisfied   with other system he want to crucify and humble himself with others   he wish to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others   to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinctionthis system of   moral help it author to forget that system make him or something   of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and   creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps Kant   especially give u to understand by his moral that what is estimable   in me is that I know how to obeyand with you it SHALL not be   otherwise than with me In short system of moral are only a   SIGNLANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS     188 In contrast to laisseraller every system of moral is a sort of   tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no   objection unless one should again decree by some system of moral that   all kind of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is   essential and invaluable in every system of moral is that it is a   long constraint In order to understand Stoicism or Port Royal   or Puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every   language ha attained to strength and freedomthe metrical constraint   the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm How much trouble have the poet and   orator of every nation given themselvesnot excepting some of   the prose writer of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable   conscientiousnessfor the sake of a folly a utilitarian bungler   say and thereby deem themselves wisefrom submission to arbitrary   law a the anarchist say and thereby fancy themselves free even   freespirited The singular fact remains however that everything   of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly   certainty which exists or ha existed whether it be in thought itself   or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just a in   conduct ha only developed by mean of the tyranny of such arbitrary   law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely   this is nature and naturaland not laisseraller Every artist   know how different from the state of letting himself go is his   most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing   and constructing in the moment of inspirationand how strictly and   delicately he then obeys a thousand law which by their very rigidness   and precision defy all formulation by mean of idea even the most   stable idea ha in comparison therewith something floating manifold   and ambiguous in it The essential thing in heaven and in earth is   apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long OBEDIENCE   in the same direction there thereby result and ha always resulted in   the long run something which ha made life worth living for instance   virtue art music dancing reason spiritualityanything whatever   that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine The long bondage of   the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of   idea the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think   in accordance with the rule of a church or a court or conformable   to Aristotelian premise the persistent spiritual will to interpret   everything that happened according to a Christian scheme and in every   occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian Godall this   violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness   ha proved itself the disciplinary mean whereby the European spirit ha   attained it strength it remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility   granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be   stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here a everywhere   nature show herself a she is in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT   magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble That   for century European thinker only thought in order to prove   somethingnowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker   who wish to prove somethingthat it wa always settled beforehand   what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking a it wa perhaps   in the Asiatic astrology of former time or a it is still at the   present day in the innocent Christianmoral explanation of immediate   personal event for the glory of God or for the good of the   soulthis tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent   stupidity ha EDUCATED the spirit slavery both in the coarser and   the finer sense is apparently an indispensable mean even of spiritual   education and discipline One may look at every system of moral in this   light it is nature therein which teach to hate the laisseraller   the too great freedom and implant the need for limited horizon for   immediate dutiesit teach the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES and thus in   a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development   Thou must obey some one and for a long time OTHERWISE thou wilt come   to grief and lose all respect for thyselfthis seems to me to be the   moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical   a old Kant wished consequently the otherwise nor doe it address   itself to the individual what doe nature care for the individual   but to nation race age and rank above all however to the   animal man generally to MANKIND     189 Industrious race find it a great hardship to be idle it wa a   master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such   an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his weekand   workday againas a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated   FAST such a is also frequently found in the ancient world although   a is appropriate in southern nation not precisely with respect   to work Many kind of fast are necessary and wherever powerful   influence and habit prevail legislator have to see that intercalary   day are appointed on which such impulse are fettered and learn to   hunger anew Viewed from a higher standpoint whole generation and   epoch when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism   seem like those intercalated period of restraint and fasting during   which an impulse learns to humble and submit itselfat the same time   also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself certain philosophical sect likewise   admit of a similar interpretation for instance the Stoa in the midst   of Hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with   Aphrodisiacal odoursHere also is a hint for the explanation of the   paradox why it wa precisely in the most Christian period of European   history and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiment   that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amourpassion     190 There is something in the morality of Plato which doe not really   belong to Plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might   say in spite of him namely Socratism for which he himself wa   too noble No one desire to injure himself hence all evil is done   unwittingly The evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do   so however if he knew that evil is evil The evil man therefore is   only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily   make himgoodThis mode of reasoning savour of the POPULACE who   perceive only the unpleasant consequence of evildoing and practically   judge that it is STUPID to do wrong while they accept good a   identical with useful and pleasant without further thought As   regard every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it   ha the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom errPlato   did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the   tenet of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into themhe   the most daring of all interpreter who lifted the entire Socrates out   of the street a a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless   and impossible modificationsnamely in all his own disguise and   multiplicity In jest and in Homeric language a well what is the   Platonic Socrates if notGreek word inserted here     191 The old theological problem of Faith and Knowledge or more   plainly of instinct and reasonthe question whether in respect to the   valuation of thing instinct deserves more authority than rationality   which want to appreciate and act according to motif according to   a Why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utilityit   is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of   Socrates and had divided men mind long before Christianity Socrates   himself following of course the taste of his talentthat of a   surpassing dialecticiantook first the side of reason and in fact   what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the   noble Athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could   never give satisfactory answer concerning the motif of their action   In the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also   at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found   in himself the same difficulty and incapacity But whyhe said   to himselfshould one on that account separate oneself from the   instinct One must set them right and the reason ALSOone must follow   the instinct but at the same time persuade the reason to support them   with good argument This wa the real FALSENESS of that great and   mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he   wa satisfied with a kind of selfoutwitting in fact he perceived   the irrationality in the moral judgmentPlato more innocent in such   matter and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to   himself at the expenditure of all his strengththe greatest strength   a philosopher had ever expendedthat reason and instinct lead   spontaneously to one goal to the good to God and since Plato all   theologian and philosopher have followed the same pathwhich mean   that in matter of morality instinct or a Christians call it   Faith or a I call it the herd ha hitherto triumphed Unless   one should make an exception in the case of Descartes the father of   rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution who   recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and   Descartes wa superficial     192 Whoever ha followed the history of a single science find in   it development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest   process of all knowledge and cognizance there a here the   premature hypothesis the fiction the good stupid will to belief   and the lack of distrust and patience are first developedour sens   learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and   cautious organ of knowledge Our eye find it easier on a given   occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon   the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more   force more morality It is difficult and painful for the ear to   listen to anything new we hear strange music badly When we hear   another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sound   into word with which we are more familiar and conversantit wa thus   for example that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into   ARMBRUST crossbow Our sens are also hostile and averse to the   new and generally even in the simplest process of sensation the   emotion DOMINATEsuch a fear love hatred and the passive emotion   of indolenceAs little a a reader nowadays read all the single word   not to speak of syllable of a pagehe rather take about five out   of every twenty word at random and guess the probably appropriate   sense to themjust a little do we see a tree correctly and completely   in respect to it leaf branch colour and shape we find it so   much easier to fancy the chance of a tree Even in the midst of the   most remarkable experience we still do just the same we fabricate the   greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate   any event EXCEPT a inventor thereof All this go to prove   that from our fundamental nature and from remote age we have   beenACCUSTOMED TO LYING Or to express it more politely and   hypocritically in short more pleasantlyone is much more of an artist   than one is aware ofIn an animated conversation I often see the face   of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined   before me according to the thought he express or which I believe to   be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the   STRENGTH of my visual facultythe delicacy of the play of the muscle   and of the expression of the eye MUST therefore be imagined by me   Probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all     193 Quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise What we   experience in dream provided we experience it often pertains at   last just a much to the general belonging of our soul a anything   actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we   have a requirement more or le and finally in broad daylight and   even in the brightest moment of our waking life we are ruled to some   extent by the nature of our dream Supposing that someone ha often   flown in his dream and that at last a soon a he dream he is   conscious of the power and art of flying a his privilege and his   peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who belief that on the   slightest impulse he can actualize all sort of curve and angle who   know the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards   without effort or constraint a downwards without descending   or loweringwithout TROUBLEhow could the man with such   dreamexperiences and dreamhabits fail to find happiness differently   coloured and defined even in his waking hour How could he failto   long DIFFERENTLY for happiness Flight such a is described by poet   must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular   violent far too troublesome for him     194 The difference among men doe not manifest itself only in the   difference of their list of desirable thingsin their regarding   different good thing a worth striving for and being disagreed a to   the greater or le value the order of rank of the commonly recognized   desirable thingsit manifest itself much more in what they regard a   actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing As regard a woman   for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification   serf a an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the   more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for   possession see the questionableness the mere apparentness of such   ownership and wish to have finer test in order to know especially   whether the woman not only give herself to him but also give up for   his sake what she ha or would like to haveonly THEN doe he look upon   her a possessed A third however ha not even here got to the limit   of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether   the woman when she give up everything for him doe not perhaps do   so for a phantom of him he wish first to be thoroughly indeed   profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he venture to let   himself be found out Only then doe he feel the beloved one fully in   his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when   she love him just a much for the sake of his devilry and concealed   insatiability a for his goodness patience and spirituality One   man would like to posse a nation and he find all the higher art of   Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose Another with a more   refined thirst for possession say to himself One may not deceive   where one desire to possesshe is irritated and impatient at the idea   that a mask of him should rule in the heart of the people I must   therefore MAKE myself known and first of all learn to know myself   Among helpful and charitable people one almost always find the awkward   craftiness which first get up suitably him who ha to be helped a   though for instance he should merit help seek just THEIR help and   would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them   for all help With these conceit they take control of the needy a a   property just a in general they are charitable and helpful out of a   desire for property One find them jealous when they are crossed or   forestalled in their charity Parents involuntarily make something like   themselves out of their childrenthey call that education no mother   doubt at the bottom of her heart that the child she ha borne is   thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN   idea and notion of worth Indeed in former time father deemed it   right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly   born a among the ancient Germans And like the father so also do the   teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new   individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession The   consequence is     195 The Jewsa people born for slavery a Tacitus and the whole   ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nation a   they themselves say and believethe Jews performed the miracle of the   inversion of valuation by mean of which life on earth obtained a new   and dangerous charm for a couple of millennium Their prophet fused   into one the expression rich godless wicked violent   sensual and for the first time coined the word world a a term of   reproach In this inversion of valuation in which is also included   the use of the word poor a synonymous with saint and friend the   significance of the Jewish people is to be found it is with THEM that   the SLAVEINSURRECTION IN MORALS commences     196 It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark body near the   sunsuch a we shall never see Among ourselves this is an allegory   and the psychologist of moral read the whole starwriting merely a an   allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed     197 The beast of prey and the man of prey for instance Caesar Borgia   are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long a   one seek a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of   all tropical monster and growth or even an innate hell in themas   almost all moralist have done hitherto Does it not seem that there is   a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropic among moralist And   that the tropical man must be discredited at all cost whether   a disease and deterioration of mankind or a his own hell and   selftorture And why In favour of the temperate zone In favour   of the temperate men The moral The mediocreThis for the chapter   Morals a Timidity     198 All the system of moral which address themselves with a view to   their happiness a it is calledwhat else are they but suggestion   for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which   the individual live recipe for their passion their good and bad   propensity insofar a such have the Will to Power and would like   to play the master small and great expediency and elaboration   permeated with the musty odour of old family medicine and oldwife   wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their formbecause   they address themselves to all because they generalize where   generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally   and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely   with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even   seductive when they are overspiced and begin to smell dangerously   especially of the other world That is all of little value when   estimated intellectually and is far from being science much le   wisdom but repeated once more and three time repeated it is   expediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupidity   stupiditywhether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness   towards the heated folly of the emotion which the Stoics advised and   fostered or the nomorelaughing and nomoreweeping of Spinoza the   destruction of the emotion by their analysis and vivisection which he   recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotion to an innocent   mean at which they may be satisfied the Aristotelianism of moral   or even morality a the enjoyment of the emotion in a voluntary   attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps a   music or a love of God and of mankind for Gods sakefor in religion   the passion are once more enfranchised provided that or finally   even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotion a ha   been taught by Hafis and Goethe the bold lettinggo of the rein the   spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional case of   wise old codger and drunkard with whom it no longer ha much   dangerThis also for the chapter Morals a Timidity     199 Inasmuch a in all age a long a mankind ha existed there have   also been human herd family alliance community tribe people   state church and always a great number who obey in proportion   to the small number who commandin view therefore of the fact that   obedience ha been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto   one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is   now innate in every one a a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which give   the command Thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally   refrain from something in short Thou shalt This need try to   satisfy itself and to fill it form with a content according to it   strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes a an omnivorous   appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into   it ear by all sort of commandersparents teacher law class   prejudice or public opinion The extraordinary limitation of human   development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and   turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herdinstinct of   obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command If   one imagine this instinct increasing to it greatest extent commander   and independent individual will finally be lacking altogether or they   will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose   a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to   command just a if they also were only obeying This condition of thing   actually exists in Europe at presentI call it the moral hypocrisy of   the commanding class They know no other way of protecting themselves   from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executor of older   and higher order of predecessor of the constitution of justice of   the law or of God himself or they even justify themselves by maxim   from the current opinion of the herd a first servant of their   people or instrument of the public weal On the other hand the   gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air a if he were the only   kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his quality such a   public spirit kindness deference industry temperance modesty   indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and   useful to the herd a the peculiarly human virtue In case however   where it is believed that the leader and bellwether can not be dispensed   with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commander   by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative   constitution for example are of this origin In spite of all what a   blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the   appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeansof this   fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon wa the last great proof   the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of   the higher happiness to which the entire century ha attained in it   worthiest individual and period     200 The man of an age of dissolution which mix the race with   one another who ha the inheritance of a diversified descent in his   bodythat is to say contrary and often not only contrary instinct   and standard of value which struggle with one another and are seldom   at peacesuch a man of late culture and broken light will on an   average be a weak man His fundamental desire is that the war which is   IN HIM should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character   of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance Epicurean   or Christian it is above all thing the happiness of repose of   undisturbedness of repletion of final unityit is the Sabbath of   Sabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician St Augustine   who wa himself such a manShould however the contrariety and   conflict in such nature operate a an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus   to lifeand if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and   irreconcilable instinct they have also inherited and indoctrinated   into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict   with themselves that is to say the faculty of selfcontrol and   selfdeception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and   inexplicable being those enigmatical men predestined for conquering   and circumventing others the finest example of which are Alcibiades   and Caesar with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans   according to my taste the Hohenstaufen Frederick the Second and   among artist perhaps Leonardo da Vinci They appear precisely in the   same period when that weaker type with it longing for repose come   to the front the two type are complementary to each other and spring   from the same cause     201 As long a the utility which determines moral estimate is only   gregarious utility a long a the preservation of the community is only   kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in   what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be   no morality of love to one neighbour Granted even that there is   already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness   gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition   of society all those instinct are already active which are latterly   distinguished by honourable name a virtue and eventually almost   coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not   a yet belong to the domain of moral valuationsthey are still   ULTRAMORAL A sympathetic action for instance is neither called good   nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the Romans and should   it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this   praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared   with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the RES   PUBLICA After all love to our neighbour is always a secondary   matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to   our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR After the fabric of society seems on the   whole established and secured against external danger it is this   fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspective of moral   valuation Certain strong and dangerous instinct such a the love of   enterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and   love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the   point of view of general utilityunder other name of course than   those here givenbut had to be fostered and cultivated because they   were perpetually required in the common danger against the common   enemy are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strongwhen   the outlet for them are lackingand are gradually branded a immoral   and given over to calumny The contrary instinct and inclination now   attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draw it   conclusion How much or how little dangerousness to the community or   to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a   disposition or an endowmentthat is now the moral perspective here   again fear is the mother of moral It is by the loftiest and strongest   instinct when they break out passionately and carry the individual   far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious   conscience that the selfreliance of the community is destroyed it   belief in itself it backbone a it were break consequently these   very instinct will be most branded and defamed The lofty independent   spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are   felt to be danger everything that elevates the individual above the   herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called   EVIL the tolerant unassuming selfadapting selfequalizing   disposition the MEDIOCRITY of desire attains to moral distinction and   honour Finally under very peaceful circumstance there is always   le opportunity and necessity for training the feeling to severity   and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begin   to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and   selfresponsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb   and still more the sheep win respect There is a point of diseased   mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society   itself take the part of him who injures it the part of the CRIMINAL   and doe so in fact seriously and honestly To punish appears to it   to be somehow unfairit is certain that the idea of punishment and   the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people Is   it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS Why should we   still punish Punishment itself is terriblewith these question   gregarious morality the morality of fear draw it ultimate   conclusion If one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear   one would have done away with this morality at the same time it   would no longer be necessary it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer   necessaryWhoever examines the conscience of the presentday European   will always elicit the same imperative from it thousand moral fold   and hidden recess the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish   that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR Some time   or otherthe will and the way THERETO is nowadays called progress all   over Europe     202 Let u at once say again what we have already said a hundred   time for people ear nowadays are unwilling to hear such truthsOUR   truth We know well enough how offensive it sound when any one   plainly and without metaphor count man among the animal but it will   be accounted to u almost a CRIME that it is precisely in respect to   men of modern idea that we have constantly applied the term herd   herdinstincts and such like expression What avail is it We can not   do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is We   have found that in all the principal moral judgment Europe ha become   unanimous including likewise the country where European influence   prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he   did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to   teachthey know today what is good and evil It must then sound hard   and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which   here think it know that which here glorifies itself with praise   and blame and call itself good is the instinct of the herding human   animal the instinct which ha come and is ever coming more and more   to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instinct   according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance   of which it is the symptom MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS   HERDINGANIMAL MORALITY and therefore a we understand the matter   only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after   which many other morality and above all HIGHER morality are or   should be possible Against such a possibility against such a should   be however this morality defends itself with all it strength it   say obstinately and inexorably I am morality itself and nothing else   is morality Indeed with the help of a religion which ha humoured   and flattered the sublimest desire of the herdinganimal thing have   reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of   this morality even in political and social arrangement the DEMOCRATIC   movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement That it TEMPO   however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient one for   those who are sick and distracted by the herdinginstinct is indicated   by the increasingly furious howling and always le disguised   teethgnashing of the anarchist dog who are now roving through the   highway of European culture Apparently in opposition to the peacefully   industrious democrat and Revolutionideologues and still more so   to the awkward philosophasters and fraternityvisionaries who call   themselves Socialists and want a free society those are really at one   with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form   of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd to the extent even of   repudiating the notion master and servantni dieu ni maitre say   a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every   special claim every special right and privilege this mean ultimately   opposition to EVERY right for when all are equal no one need right   any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice a though it   were a violation of the weak unfair to the NECESSARY consequence of   all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy   in their compassion for all that feel life and suffers down to the   very animal up even to Godthe extravagance of sympathy for   God belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and   impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering   generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or   ALLOWING it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heartsoftening   under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new   Buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy a   though it were morality in itself the climax the ATTAINED climax of   mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present   the great discharge from all the obligation of the past altogether at   one in their belief in the community a the DELIVERER in the herd and   therefore in themselves     203 We who hold a different beliefwe who regard the democratic   movement not only a a degenerating form of political organization but   a equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man a involving his   mediocrising and depreciation where have WE to fix our hope In   NEW PHILOSOPHERSthere is no other alternative in mind strong and   original enough to initiate opposite estimate of value to transvalue   and invert eternal valuation in forerunner in men of the future   who in the present shall fix the constraint and fasten the knot which   will compel millennium to take NEW path To teach man the future   of humanity a his WILL a depending on human will and to make   preparation for vast hazardous enterprise and collective attempt in   rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful   rule of folly and chance which ha hitherto gone by the name of   history the folly of the greatest number is only it last   formfor that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will   some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that   ha existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent being might   look pale and dwarfed The image of such leader hovers before OUR   eyesis it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirit The   condition which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for   their genesis the presumptive method and test by virtue of which   a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power a to feel a   CONSTRAINT to these task a transvaluation of value under the new   pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart   transformed into brass so a to bear the weight of such responsibility   and on the other hand the necessity for such leader the dreadful   danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degeneratethese   are OUR real anxiety and gloom ye know it well ye free spirit   these are the heavy distant thought and storm which sweep across the   heaven of OUR life There are few pain so grievous a to have seen   divined or experienced how an exceptional man ha missed his way and   deteriorated but he who ha the rare eye for the universal danger   of man himself DETERIORATING he who like u ha recognized the   extraordinary fortuitousness which ha hitherto played it game in   respect to the future of mankinda game in which neither the hand nor   even a finger of God ha participatedhe who divine the fate that   is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of   modern idea and still more under the whole of ChristoEuropean   moralitysuffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared   He see at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through   a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human power and   arrangement he know with all the knowledge of his conviction how   unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibility and how often   in the past the type man ha stood in presence of mysterious decision   and new pathshe know still better from his painfulest recollection   on what wretched obstacle promising development of the highest rank   have hitherto usually gone to piece broken down sunk and become   contemptible The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of   the man of the futureas idealized by the socialistic fool and   shallowpatesthis degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely   gregarious animal or a they call it to a man of free society   this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal right and claim is   undoubtedly POSSIBLE He who ha thought out this possibility to it   ultimate conclusion know ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of   mankindand perhaps also a new MISSION         CHAPTER VI WE SCHOLARS       204 At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here a that   which it ha always beennamely resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES   according to BalzacI would venture to protest against an improper and   injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and a if with the   best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relation   of science and philosophy I mean to say that one must have the right   out of one own EXPERIENCEexperience a it seems to me always   implies unfortunate experienceto treat of such an important question   of rank so a not to speak of colour like the blind or AGAINST science   like woman and artist Ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct   and their shame it always FINDS THINGS OUT The declaration of   independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy   is one of the subtler aftereffect of democratic organization and   disorganization the selfglorification and selfconceitedness of   the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in it best   springtimewhich doe not mean to imply that in this case selfpraise   smell sweet Here also the instinct of the populace cry Freedom   from all master and after science ha with the happiest result   resisted theology whose handmaid it had been too long it now   proposes in it wantonness and indiscretion to lay down law for   philosophy and in it turn to play the masterwhat am I saying   to play the PHILOSOPHER on it own account My memorythe memory of   a scientific man if you pleaseteems with the naivete of insolence   which I have heard about philosophy and philosopher from young   naturalist and old physician not to mention the most cultured and   most conceited of all learned men the philologist and schoolmaster   who are both the one and the other by profession On one occasion it   wa the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the   defensive against all synthetic task and capability at another time   it wa the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined   luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt   himself aggrieved and belittled thereby On another occasion it wa the   colourblindness of the utilitarian who see nothing in philosophy but   a series of REFUTED system and an extravagant expenditure which doe   nobody any good At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of   the boundaryadjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another   time the disregard of individual philosopher which had involuntarily   extended to disregard of philosophy generally In fine I found most   frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholar   the evil aftereffect of some particular philosopher to whom on the   whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his   scornful estimate of other philosopher having been got rid ofthe   result being a general illwill to all philosophy Such seems to   me for instance the aftereffect of Schopenhauer on the most modern   Germany by his unintelligent rage against Hegel he ha succeeded in   severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from it connection   with German culture which culture all thing considered ha been   an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE but   precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself wa poor irreceptive   and unGerman to the extent of ingeniousness On the whole speaking   generally it may just have been the humanness alltoohumanness of the   modern philosopher themselves in short their contemptibleness which   ha injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the   door to the instinct of the populace Let it but be acknowledged to   what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the   world of Heraclitus Plato Empedocles and whatever else all the royal   and magnificent anchorite of the spirit were called and with what   justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and   origin in view of such representative of philosophy who owing to   the fashion of the present day are just a much aloft a they are down   belowin Germany for instance the two lion of Berlin the anarchist   Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann It is especially   the sight of those hotchpotch philosopher who call themselves   realist or positivist which is calculated to implant a   dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those   philosopher at the best are themselves but scholar and specialist   that is very evident All of them are person who have been vanquished   and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science who at one time   or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the   more and it responsibilityand who now creditably rancorously and   vindictively represent in word and deed DISBELIEF in the mastertask   and supremacy of philosophy After all how could it be otherwise   Science flourish nowadays and ha the good conscience clearly visible   on it countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy ha   gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites   distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to   a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of   epoch and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even   get beyond the threshold and rigorously DENIES itself the right   to enterthat is philosophy in it last throe an end an agony   something that awakens pity How could such a philosophyRULE     205 The danger that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in   fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit   could still come to maturity The extent and towering structure of the   science have increased enormously and therewith also the probability   that the philosopher will grow tired even a a learner or will attach   himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to   his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection   and his DESPECTION Or he get aloft too late when the best of his   maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and   deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of thing is no   longer of much importance It is perhaps just the refinement of his   intellectual conscience that make him hesitate and linger on the   way he dread the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede a   milleantenna he know too well that a a discerner one who ha lost   his selfrespect no longer command no longer LEADS unless he should   aspire to become a great playactor a philosophical Cagliostro and   spiritual ratcatcherin short a misleader This is in the last   instance a question of taste if it ha not really been a question of   conscience To double once more the philosopher difficulty there is   also the fact that he demand from himself a verdict a Yea or Nay not   concerning science but concerning life and the worth of lifehe learns   unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain   this verdict and he ha to seek his way to the right and the belief   only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying   experience often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded In fact the   philosopher ha long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either   with the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiously   elevated desensualized desecularized visionary and Godintoxicated   man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he life   wisely or a a philosopher it hardly mean anything more than   prudently and apart Wisdom that seems to the populace to be a kind   of flight a mean and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a   bad game but the GENUINE philosopherdoes it not seem so to US   my friendslives unphilosophically and unwisely above all   IMPRUDENTLY and feel the obligation and burden of a hundred attempt   and temptation of lifehe risk HIMSELF constantly he play THIS bad   game     206 In relation to the genius that is to say a being who either   ENGENDERS or PRODUCESboth word understood in their fullest sensethe   man of learning the scientific average man ha always something of   the old maid about him for like her he is not conversant with the two   principal function of man To both of course to the scholar and   to the old maid one concedes respectability a if by way of   indemnificationin these case one emphasizes the respectabilityand   yet in the compulsion of this concession one ha the same admixture   of vexation Let u examine more closely what is the scientific man   Firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtue that is   to say a nonruling nonauthoritative and nonselfsufficient type   of man he posse industry patient adaptableness to rank and file   equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he ha the   instinct for people like himself and for that which they requirefor   instance the portion of independence and green meadow without which   there is no rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration   which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability   the sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value and   usefulness with which the inward DISTRUST which lie at the bottom of   the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animal ha again and   again to be overcome The learned man a is appropriate ha also   malady and fault of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and   ha a lynxeye for the weak point in those nature to whose elevation   he can not attain He is confiding yet only a one who let himself go   but doe not FLOW and precisely before the man of the great current he   stand all the colder and more reservedhis eye is then like a smooth   and irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy   The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable result   from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the Jesuitism of   mediocrity which labour instinctively for the destruction of   the exceptional man and endeavour to breakor still better to   relaxevery bent bow To relax of course with consideration and   naturally with an indulgent handto RELAX with confiding sympathy   that is the real art of Jesuitism which ha always understood how to   introduce itself a the religion of sympathy     207 However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spiritand   who ha not been sick to death of all subjectivity and it confounded   IPSISIMOSITYin the end however one must learn caution even with   regard to one gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with   which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit ha recently been   celebrated a if it were the goal in itself a if it were salvation   and glorificationas is especially accustomed to happen in the   pessimist school which ha also in it turn good reason for paying the   highest honour to disinterested knowledge The objective man who no   longer curse and scold like the pessimist the IDEAL man of learning   in whom the scientific instinct blossom forth fully after a thousand   complete and partial failure is assuredly one of the most costly   instrument that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more   powerful He is only an instrument we may say he is a MIRRORhe is no   purpose in himself The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed   to prostration before everything that want to be known with such   desire only a knowing or reflecting implieshe wait until   something come and then expands himself sensitively so that even the   light footstep and glidingpast of spiritual being may not be lost on   his surface and film Whatever personality he still posse seems to   him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much ha he   come to regard himself a the passage and reflection of outside form   and event He call up the recollection of himself with an effort   and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other   person he make mistake with regard to his own need and here only   is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health   or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack   of companion and societyindeed he set himself to reflect on his   suffering but in vain His thought already rove away to the MORE   GENERAL case and tomorrow he know a little a he knew yesterday how   to help himself He doe not now take himself seriously and devote time   to himself he is serene NOT from lack of trouble but from lack   of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual   complaisance with respect to all object and experience the radiant   and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that   come his way his habit of inconsiderate goodnature of dangerous   indifference a to Yea and Nay ala there are enough of case in which   he ha to atone for these virtue of hisand a man generally he   becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtue Should one   wish love or hatred from himI mean love and hatred a God woman and   animal understand themhe will do what he can and furnish what he can   But one must not be surprised if it should not be muchif he should   show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and   deteriorated His love is constrained his hatred is artificial and   rather UN TOUR DE FORCE a slight ostentation and exaggeration He is   only genuine so far a he can be objective only in his serene totality   is he still nature and natural His mirroring and eternally   selfpolishing soul no longer know how to affirm no longer how to   deny he doe not command neither doe he destroy JE NE MEPRISE   PRESQUE RIENhe say with Leibniz let u not overlook nor undervalue   the PRESQUE Neither is he a model man he doe not go in advance of any   one nor after either he place himself generally too far off to have   any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil If he ha   been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER with the Caesarian trainer   and dictator of civilization he ha had far too much honour and what   is more essential in him ha been overlookedhe is an instrument   something of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but   nothing in himselfPRESQUE RIEN The objective man is an instrument   a costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and   mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he   is no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom the   REST of existence justifies itself no terminationand still le a   commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful   selfcentred that want to be master but rather only a soft inflated   delicate movable pottersform that must wait for some kind of content   and frame to shape itself theretofor the most part a man without   frame and content a selfless man Consequently also nothing for   woman IN PARENTHESI     208 When a philosopher nowadays make known that he is not a skepticI   hope that ha been gathered from the foregoing description of the   objective spiritpeople all hear it impatiently they regard him on   that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many   many question indeed among timid hearer of whom there are now so   many he is henceforth said to be dangerous With his repudiation of   skepticism it seems to them a if they heard some evilthreatening   sound in the distance a if a new kind of explosive were being tried   somewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered Russian   NIHILINE a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS that not only denies mean   denial butdreadful thought PRACTISES denial Against this kind of   goodwilla will to the veritable actual negation of lifethere is   a is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedative   than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism   and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctor of the day a an   antidote to the spirit and it underground noise Are not our ear   already full of bad sound say the skeptic a lover of repose and   almost a a kind of safety police this subterranean Nay is terrible   Be still ye pessimistic mole The skeptic in effect that delicate   creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so   a to start at every Nay and even at that sharp decided Yea and feel   something like a bite thereby Yea and Naythey seem to him opposed   to morality he love on the contrary to make a festival to his virtue   by a noble aloofness while perhaps he say with Montaigne What do I   know Or with Socrates I know that I know nothing Or Here I do   not trust myself no door is open to me Or Even if the door were   open why should I enter immediately Or What is the use of any hasty   hypothesis It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypothesis   at all Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is   crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum Is there not time   enough for that Has not the time leisure Oh ye demon can ye not   at all WAIT The uncertain also ha it charm the Sphinx too is a   Circe and Circe too wa a philosopherThus doe a skeptic console   himself and in truth he need some consolation For skepticism is   the most spiritual expression of a certain manysided physiological   temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and   sickliness it arises whenever race or class which have been long   separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another In the new   generation which ha inherited a it were different standard and   valuation in it blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt and   tentativeness the best power operate restrictively the very virtue   prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast   and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul That however   which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescript is the   WILL they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or   the courageous feeling of pleasure in willingthey are doubtful of the   freedom of the will even in their dream Our presentday Europe   the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of   class and CONSEQUENTLY of race is therefore skeptical in all it   height and depth sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which   spring impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with   gloomy aspect like a cloud overcharged with interrogative signsand   often sick unto death of it will Paralysis of will where do we not   find this cripple sitting nowadays And yet how bedecked oftentimes How   seductively ornamented There are the finest gala dress and disguise   for this disease and that for instance most of what place itself   nowadays in the showcase a objectiveness the scientific spirit   LART POUR LART and pure voluntary knowledge is only deckedout   skepticism and paralysis of willI am ready to answer for this   diagnosis of the European diseaseThe disease of the will is diffused   unequally over Europe it is worst and most varied where civilization   ha longest prevailed it decrease according a the barbarian   stillor againasserts his claim under the loose drapery of Western   culture It is therefore in the France of today a can be readily   disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and France   which ha always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the   portentous crisis of it spirit into something charming and seductive   now manifest emphatically it intellectual ascendancy over Europe   by being the school and exhibition of all the charm of skepticism The   power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already   somewhat stronger in Germany and again in the North of Germany it   is stronger than in Central Germany it is considerably stronger in   England Spain and Corsica associated with phlegm in the former and   with hard skull in the latternot to mention Italy which is too young   yet to know what it want and must first show whether it can exercise   will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense   middle empire where Europe a it were flow back to Asianamely in   Russia There the power to will ha been long stored up and accumulated   there the willuncertain whether to be negative or affirmativewaits   threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our   physicist Perhaps not only Indian war and complication in Asia would   be necessary to free Europe from it greatest danger but also internal   subversion the shattering of the empire into small state and above   all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the   obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not   say this a one who desire it in my heart I should rather prefer the   contraryI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of   Russia that Europe would have to make up it mind to become equally   threateningnamely TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL by mean of a new caste to   rule over the Continent a persistent dreadful will of it own that   can set it aim thousand of year ahead so that the long spunout   comedy of it pettystatism and it dynastic a well a it democratic   manywilledness might finally be brought to a close The time for   petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle for the   dominion of the worldthe COMPULSION to great politics     209 As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have   evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger   kind of skepticism I should like to express myself preliminarily   merely by a parable which the lover of German history will already   understand That unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadier   who a King of Prussia brought into being a military and skeptical   geniusand therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emerged   type of German the problematic crazy father of Frederick the Great   had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew   what wa then lacking in Germany the want of which wa a hundred time   more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social formhis   illwill to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound   instinct MEN WERE LACKING and he suspected to his bitterest regret   that his own son wa not man enough There however he deceived   himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place He saw   his son lapsed to atheism to the ESPRIT to the pleasant frivolity of   clever Frenchmenhe saw in the background the great bloodsucker the   spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no   longer hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that no   longer command is no longer ABLE to command Meanwhile however   there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous   skepticismwho know TO WHAT EXTENT it wa encouraged just by   his father hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to   solitudethe skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related   to the genius for war and conquest and made it first entrance into   Germany in the person of the great Frederick This skepticism despises   and nevertheless grasp it undermines and take possession it doe   not believe but it doe not thereby lose itself it give the spirit a   dangerous liberty but it keep strict guard over the heart It is the   GERMAN form of skepticism which a a continued Fredericianism risen   to the highest spirituality ha kept Europe for a considerable time   under the dominion of the German spirit and it critical and historical   distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character   of the great German philologist and historical critic who   rightly estimated were also all of them artist of destruction   and dissolution a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually   established itselfin spite of all Romanticism in music and   philosophyin which the leaning towards masculine skepticism wa   decidedly prominent whether for instance a fearlessness of gaze a   courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or a resolute will to   dangerous voyage of discovery to spiritualized North Pole expedition   under barren and dangerous sky There may be good ground for it when   warmblooded and superficial humanitarian cross themselves before this   spirit CET ESPRIT FATALISTE IRONIQUE MEPHISTOPHELIQUE a Michelet   call it not without a shudder But if one would realize how   characteristic is this fear of the man in the German spirit which   awakened Europe out of it dogmatic slumber let u call to mind the   former conception which had to be overcome by this new oneand that   it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare with   unbridled presumption to recommend the Germans to the interest of   Europe a gentle goodhearted weakwilled and poetical fool   Finally let u only understand profoundly enough Napoleons   astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for   century a the German spirit VOILA UN HOMMEthat wa a much a   to say But this is a MAN And I only expected to see a German     210 Supposing then that in the picture of the philosopher of the   future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps   be skeptic in the lastmentioned sense something in them would only be   designated therebyand not they themselves With equal right they might   call themselves critic and assuredly they will be men of experiment   By the name with which I ventured to baptize them I have already   expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is   this because a critic in body and soul they will love to make use   of experiment in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense In   their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and   painful attempt than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic   century can approve ofThere is no doubt these coming one will be   least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous quality   which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty a to   standard of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method   the wary courage the standingalone and the capacity for   selfresponsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT   in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which know   how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds   They will be STERNER and perhaps not always towards themselves only   than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in   order that it may please them or elevate and inspire themthey   will rather have little faith in TRUTH bringing with it such revel   for the feeling They will smile those rigorous spirit when any one   say in their presence That thought elevates me why should it not be   true or That work enchants me why should it not be beautiful or   That artist enlarges me why should he not be great Perhaps they   will not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thus   rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one   could look into their inmost heart he would not easily find therein   the intention to reconcile Christian sentiment with antique taste   or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliation   necessarily found even among philosopher in our very uncertain and   consequently very conciliatory century Critical discipline and every   habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matter   will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosopher of   the future they may even make a display thereof a their special   adornmentnevertheless they will not want to be called critic on that   account It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to   have it decreed a is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is   criticism and critical scienceand nothing else whatever Though this   estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of   France and Germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste   of KANT let u call to mind the title of his principal work our new   philosopher will say notwithstanding that critic are instrument of   the philosopher and just on that account a instrument they are   far from being philosopher themselves Even the great Chinaman of   Konigsberg wa only a great critic     211 I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding   philosophical worker and in general scientific men with   philosophersthat precisely here one should strictly give each his   own and not give those far too much these far too little It may   be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself   should have once stood upon all those step upon which his servant   the scientific worker of philosophy remain standing and MUST remain   standing he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist   and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and   riddlereader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost   everything in order to traverse the whole range of human value   and estimation and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eye and   conscience to look from a height to any distance from a depth up   to any height from a nook into any expanse But all these are only   preliminary condition for his task this task itself demand something   elseit requires him TO CREATE VALUES The philosophical worker after   the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel have to fix and formalize some   great existing body of valuationsthat is to say former DETERMINATIONS   OF VALUE creation of value which have become prevalent and are for   a time called truthswhether in the domain of the LOGICAL the   POLITICAL moral or the ARTISTIC It is for these investigator to   make whatever ha happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous   conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long   even time itself and to SUBJUGATE the entire past an immense and   wonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride all   tenacious will can surely find satisfaction THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS   HOWEVER ARE COMMANDERS AND LAWGIVERS they say Thus SHALL it be   They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind and thereby   set aside the previous labour of all philosophical worker and all   subjugator of the pastthey grasp at the future with a creative   hand and whatever is and wa becomes for them thereby a mean an   instrument and a hammer Their knowing is CREATING their creating   is a lawgiving their will to truth isWILL TO POWERAre there at   present such philosopher Have there ever been such philosopher MUST   there not be such philosopher some day      212 It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher a a man   INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow ha ever   found himself and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself in contradiction   to the day in which he life his enemy ha always been the ideal of his   day Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one   call philosopherswho rarely regarded themselves a lover of wisdom   but rather a disagreeable fool and dangerous interrogatorshave found   their mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end   however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of   their age In putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the very   VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE they have betrayed their own secret it ha been   for the sake of a NEW greatness of man a new untrodden path to   his aggrandizement They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy   indolence selfindulgence and selfneglect how much falsehood wa   concealed under the most venerated type of contemporary morality how   much virtue wa OUTLIVED they have always said We must remove hence to   where YOU are least at home In the face of a world of modern idea   which would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty a   philosopher if there could be philosopher nowadays would be compelled   to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely   in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his allroundness he   would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety   of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the   EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the   taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is   so adapted to the spirit of the age a weakness of will consequently in   the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity   for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception   of greatness with a good a right a the opposite doctrine with it   ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity wa suited to   an opposite agesuch a the sixteenth century which suffered from it   accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrent and flood   of selfishness In the time of Socrates among men only of wornout   instinct old conservative Athenians who let themselves gofor the   sake of happiness a they said for the sake of pleasure a their   conduct indicatedand who had continually on their lip the old pompous   word to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led   IRONY wa perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked Socratic   assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his   own flesh a into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that   said plainly enough Do not dissemble before me herewe are equal   At present on the contrary when throughout Europe the herdinganimal   alone attains to honour and dispenses honour when equality of   right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrongI mean to   say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged   against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher   responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordlinessat present   it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to be   apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live   by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his   own ideal when he asserts He shall be the greatest who can be the most   solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good   and evil the master of his virtue and of superabundance of will   precisely this shall be called GREATNESS a diversified a can be   entire a ample a can be full And to ask once more the question Is   greatness POSSIBLEnowadays     213 It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it can not   be taught one must know it by experienceor one should have the   pride NOT to know it The fact that at present people all talk of thing   of which they CANNOT have any experience is true more especially   and unfortunately a concern the philosopher and philosophical   mattersthe very few know them are permitted to know them and   all popular idea about them are false Thus for instance the truly   philosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which run   at presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which make no   false step is unknown to most thinker and scholar from their own   experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their   presence it is incredible to them They conceive of every necessity a   troublesome a a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint   thinking itself is regarded by them a something slow and hesitating   almost a a trouble and often enough a worthy of the SWEAT of the   noblebut not at all a something easy and divine closely related   to dancing and exuberance To think and to take a matter seriously   arduouslythat is one and the same thing to them such only ha been   their experienceArtists have here perhaps a finer intuition they   who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything   arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom   of subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shaping   reach it climaxin short that necessity and freedom of will are   then the same thing with them There is in fine a gradation of rank   in psychical state to which the gradation of rank in the problem   corresponds and the highest problem repel ruthlessly every one who   venture too near them without being predestined for their solution   by the loftiness and power of his spirituality Of what use is it for   nimble everyday intellect or clumsy honest mechanic and empiricist   to press in their plebeian ambition close to such problem and a   it were into this holy of holiesas so often happens nowadays But   coarse foot must never tread upon such carpet this is provided for in   the primary law of thing the door remain closed to those intruder   though they may dash and break their head thereon People have always   to be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be BRED   for it a person ha only a right to philosophytaking the word in   it higher significancein virtue of his descent the ancestor the   blood decide here also Many generation must have prepared the way   for the coming of the philosopher each of his virtue must have been   separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the   bold easy delicate course and current of his thought but above all   the readiness for great responsibility the majesty of ruling glance   and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with   their duty and virtue the kindly patronage and defense of whatever   is misunderstood and calumniated be it God or devil the delight and   practice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude of   will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely look up rarely   love         CHAPTER VII OUR VIRTUES       214 OUR VirtuesIt is probable that we too have still our virtue   although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtue on   account of which we hold our grandfather in esteem and also at a little   distance from u We Europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlings   of the twentieth centurywith all our dangerous curiosity our   multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly   sweetened cruelty in sense and spiritwe shall presumably IF we must   have virtue have those only which have come to agreement with our most   secret and heartfelt inclination with our most ardent requirement   well then let u look for them in our labyrinthswhere a we know   so many thing lose themselves so many thing get quite lost And is   there anything finer than to SEARCH for one own virtue Is it not   almost to BELIEVE in one own virtue But this believing in one   own virtuesis it not practically the same a what wa formerly called   one good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea   which our grandfather used to hang behind their head and often enough   also behind their understanding It seems therefore that however   little we may imagine ourselves to be oldfashioned and grandfatherly   respectable in other respect in one thing we are nevertheless the   worthy grandchild of our grandfather we last Europeans with good   conscience we also still wear their pigtailAh if you only knew how   soon so very soonit will be different     215 As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two sun which   determine the path of one planet and in certain case sun of different   colour shine around a single planet now with red light now with   green and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley   colour so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our   firmament are determined by DIFFERENT morality our action shine   alternately in different colour and are seldom unequivocaland there   are often case also in which our action are MOTLEYCOLOURED     216 To love one enemy I think that ha been well learnt it take   place thousand of time at present on a large and small scale indeed   at time the higher and sublimer thing take placewe learn to DESPISE   when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however   unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and   secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word   and the formula of virtue Morality a attitudeis opposed to our taste   nowadays This is ALSO an advance a it wa an advance in our father   that religion a an attitude finally became opposed to their taste   including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion and all   that formerly belonged to freethinkerpantomime It is the music in our   conscience the dance in our spirit to which Puritan litany moral   sermon and goodygoodness wo nt chime     217 Let u be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance   to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment   They never forgive u if they have once made a mistake BEFORE u   or even with REGARD to usthey inevitably become our instinctive   calumniators and detractor even when they still remain our   friendsBlessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of   their blunder     218 The psychologist of Franceand where else are there still   psychologist nowadayshave never yet exhausted their bitter and   manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just a though in   short they betray something thereby Flaubert for instance the honest   citizen of Rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the   end it wa his mode of selftorment and refined cruelty As this is   growing wearisome I would now recommend for a change something else   for a pleasurenamely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat   honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirit and the task   they have to perform the subtle barbed Jesuitical astuteness which   is a thousand time subtler than the taste and understanding of the   middleclass in it best momentssubtler even than the understanding of   it victimsa repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent   of all kind of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered In   short you psychologist study the philosophy of the rule in it   struggle with the exception there you have a spectacle fit for Gods   and godlike malignity Or in plainer word practise vivisection on   good people on the homo bonae voluntatis ON YOURSELVES     219 The practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite   revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are le so it is   also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature   and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING   subtlemalice spiritualises They are glad in their inmost heart that   there is a standard according to which those who are overendowed with   intellectual good and privilege are equal to them they contend for   the equality of all before God and almost NEED the belief in God for   this purpose It is among them that the most powerful antagonist of   atheism are found If any one were to say to them A lofty spirituality   is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely   moral manit would make them furious I shall take care not to say   so I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality   itself exists only a the ultimate product of moral quality that it   is a synthesis of all quality attributed to the merely moral man   after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice   perhaps during a whole series of generation that lofty spirituality   is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severity   which know that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the   world even among thingsand not only among men     220 Now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular   one mustprobably not without some dangerget an idea of WHAT people   actually take an interest in and what are the thing generally which   fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary menincluding the   cultured even the learned and perhaps philosopher also if   appearance do not deceive The fact thereby becomes obvious that the   greater part of what interest and charm higher nature and more   refined and fastidious taste seems absolutely uninteresting to   the average manif notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these   interest he call it desinteresse and wonder how it is possible to   act disinterestedly There have been philosopher who could give this   popular astonishment a seductive and mystical otherworldly expression   perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience   instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that   disinterested action is very interesting and interested action   provided that And loveWhat Even an action for love sake   shall be unegoistic But you fool And the praise of the   selfsacrificerBut whoever ha really offered sacrifice know that   he wanted and obtained something for itperhaps something from himself   for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have   more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more   But this is a realm of question and answer in which a more fastidious   spirit doe not like to stay for here truth ha to stifle her yawn so   much when she is obliged to answer And after all truth is a woman one   must not use force with her     221 It sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant and   trifleretailer that I honour and respect an unselfish man not   however because he is unselfish but because I think he ha a right to   be useful to another man at his own expense In short the question   is always who HE is and who THE OTHER is For instance in a person   created and destined for command selfdenial and modest retirement   instead of being virtue would be the waste of virtue so it seems   to me Every system of unegoistic morality which take itself   unconditionally and appeal to every one not only sin against good   taste but is also an incentive to sin of omission an ADDITIONAL   seduction under the mask of philanthropyand precisely a seduction and   injury to the higher rarer and more privileged type of men Moral   system must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF   RANK their presumption must be driven home to their conscienceuntil   they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that what   is right for one is proper for anotherSo said my moralistic pedant   and bonhomme Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus   exhorted system of moral to practise morality But one should not be   too much in the right if one wish to have the laugher on ONES OWN   side a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste     222 Wherever sympathy fellowsuffering is preached nowadaysand   if I gather rightly no other religion is any longer preachedlet the   psychologist have his ear open through all the vanity through all the   noise which is natural to these preacher a to all preacher he will   hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of SELFCONTEMPT It belongs   to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe which ha been on   the increase for a century the first symptom of which are already   specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame   dEpinayIF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF The man of   modern idea the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied with   himselfthis is perfectly certain He suffers and his vanity want him   only to suffer with his fellow     223 The hybrid Europeana tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in   allabsolutely requires a costume he need history a a storeroom   of costume To be sure he notice that none of the costume fit him   properlyhe change and change Let u look at the nineteenth century   with respect to these hasty preference and change in it masquerade   of style and also with respect to it moment of desperation on account   of nothing suiting u It is in vain to get ourselves up a romantic   or classical or Christian or Florentine or barocco or national   in moribus et artibus it doe not clothe u But the spirit   especially the historical spirit profit even by this desperation   once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested   put on taken off packed up and above all studiedwe are the first   studious age in puncto of costume I mean a concern moral   article of belief artistic taste and religion we are prepared a   no other age ha ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the   most spiritual festivallaughter and arrogance for the transcendental   height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world Perhaps   we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the   domain where even we can still be original probably a parodist of   the world history and a Gods MerryAndrewsperhaps though nothing   else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a   future     224 The historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly   the order of rank of the valuation according to which a people a   community or an individual ha lived the divining instinct for the   relationship of these valuation for the relation of the authority   of the valuation to the authority of the operating forcesthis   historical sense which we Europeans claim a our specialty ha come   to u in the train of the enchanting and mad semibarbarity into which   Europe ha been plunged by the democratic mingling of class and   racesit is only the nineteenth century that ha recognized this   faculty a it sixth sense Owing to this mingling the past of every   form and mode of life and of culture which were formerly closely   contiguous and superimposed on one another flow forth into u modern   soul our instinct now run back in all direction we ourselves are   a kind of chaos in the end a we have said the spirit perceives it   advantage therein By mean of our semibarbarity in body and in desire   we have secret access everywhere such a a noble age never had we have   access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilization and to   every form of semibarbarity that ha at any time existed on earth and   in so far a the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto   ha just been semibarbarity the historical sense implies almost the   sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything   whereby it immediately prof itself to be an IGNOBLE sense For   instance we enjoy Homer once more it is perhaps our happiest   acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer whom men of   distinguished culture a the French of the seventeenth century like   SaintEvremond who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE and even   Voltaire the last echo of the century can not and could not so easily   appropriatewhom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy The very   decided Yea and Nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their   hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of   the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of   every distinguished and selfsufficing culture to avow a new desire   a dissatisfaction with it own condition or an admiration of what is   strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards   the best thing of the world which are not their property or could not   become their preyand no faculty is more unintelligible to such men   than just this historical sense with it truckling plebeian   curiosity The case is not different with Shakespeare that marvelous   SpanishMoorishSaxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient Athenian   of the circle of AEschylus would have halfkilled himself with laughter   or irritation but weaccept precisely this wild motleyness this   medley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificial   with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it a a refinement   of art reserved expressly for u and allow ourselves to be a little   disturbed by the repulsive fume and the proximity of the English   populace in which Shakespeares art and taste life a perhaps on   the Chiaja of Naples where with all our sens awake we go our way   enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drainodour of the lower   quarter of the town That a men of the historical sense we have   our virtue is not to be disputedwe are unpretentious unselfish   modest brave habituated to selfcontrol and selfrenunciation very   grateful very patient very complaisantbut with all this we are   perhaps not very tasteful Let u finally confess it that what is   most difficult for u men of the historical sense to grasp feel   taste and love what find u fundamentally prejudiced and almost   hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every   culture and art the essentially noble in work and men their moment   of smooth sea and halcyon selfsufficiency the goldenness and coldness   which all thing show that have perfected themselves Perhaps our great   virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste   at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves   imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and   happy godsend and glorification of human life a they shine here and   there those moment and marvelous experience when a great power ha   voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinitewhen a   superabundance of refined delight ha been enjoyed by a sudden checking   and petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still   trembling ground PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to u let u confess it   to ourselves our itching is really the itching for the infinite the   immeasurable Like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the   rein fall before the infinite we modern men we semibarbariansand   are only in OUR highest bliss when weARE IN MOST DANGER     225 Whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism   all those mode of thinking which measure the worth of thing according   to PLEASURE and PAIN that is according to accompanying circumstance   and secondary consideration are plausible mode of thought and   naivete which every one conscious of CREATIVE power and an artist   conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy   Sympathy for youto be sure that is not sympathy a you understand   it it is not sympathy for social distress for society with it   sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie   on the ground around u still le is it sympathy for the grumbling   vexed revolutionary slaveclasses who strive after powerthey call it   freedom OUR sympathy is a loftier and furthersighted sympathywe   see how MAN dwarf himself how YOU dwarf him and there are moment   when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist   itwhen we regard your seriousness a more dangerous than any kind   of levity You want if possibleand there is not a more foolish if   possibleTO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING and weit really seems that WE   would rather have it increased and made worse than it ha ever been   Wellbeing a you understand itis certainly not a goal it seems   to u an END a condition which at once render man ludicrous and   contemptibleand make his destruction DESIRABLE The discipline   of suffering of GREAT sufferingknow ye not that it is only THIS   discipline that ha produced all the elevation of humanity hitherto   The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it it energy   it shuddering in view of rack and ruin it inventiveness and bravery   in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and   whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness ha   been bestowed upon the soulhas it not been bestowed through suffering   through the discipline of great suffering In man CREATURE and CREATOR   are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire   folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness   of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh daydo   ye understand this contrast And that YOUR sympathy for the creature   in man applies to that which ha to be fashioned bruised forged   stretched roasted annealed refinedto that which must necessarily   SUFFER and IS MEANT to suffer And our sympathydo ye not understand   what our REVERSE sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy a   the worst of all pampering and enervationSo it is sympathy AGAINST   sympathyBut to repeat it once more there are higher problem than   the problem of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all system of   philosophy which deal only with these are naivete     226 WE IMMORALISTSThis world with which WE are concerned in which   we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of   delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every   respect captious insidious sharp and tenderyes it is well   protected from clumsy spectator and familiar curiosity We are   woven into a strong net and garment of duty and CANNOT disengage   ourselvesprecisely here we are men of duty even we Occasionally   it is true we dance in our chain and betwixt our sword it   is none the le true that more often we gnash our teeth under the   circumstance and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot But   do what we will fool and appearance say of u These are men WITHOUT   dutywe have always fool and appearance against u     227 Honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we can not rid   ourselves we free spiritswell we will labour at it with all our   perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in OUR   virtue which alone remains may it glance some day overspread like   a gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with it dull   gloomy seriousness And if nevertheless our honesty should one

appliancesand that virtue in my opinion ha been MORE injured   by the TEDIOUSNESS of it advocate than by anything else at the same   time however I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness It   is desirable that a few people a possible should reflect upon moral   and consequently it is very desirable that moral should not some day   become interesting But let u not be afraid Things still remain today   a they have always been I see no one in Europe who ha or DISCLOSES   an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning moral might be   conducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring mannerthat CALAMITY   might be involved therein Observe for example the indefatigable   inevitable English utilitarian how ponderously and respectably they   stalk on stalk along a Homeric metaphor express it better in the   footstep of Bentham just a he had already stalked in the footstep of   the respectable Helvetius no he wa not a dangerous man Helvetius   CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE to use an expression of Galiani No new   thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression   of an old thought not even a proper history of what ha been previously   thought on the subject an IMPOSSIBLE literature taking it all in all   unless one know how to leaven it with some mischief In effect the   old English vice called CANT which is MORAL TARTUFFISM ha insinuated   itself also into these moralist whom one must certainly read with an   eye to their motif if one MUST read them concealed this time under   the new form of the scientific spirit moreover there is not absent   from them a secret struggle with the pang of conscience from which a   race of former Puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientific   tinkering with moral Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan   That is to say a a thinker who regard morality a questionable   a worthy of interrogation in short a a problem Is moralizing   notimmoral In the end they all want English morality to be   recognized a authoritative inasmuch a mankind or the general   utility or the happiness of the greatest numberno the happiness   of ENGLAND will be best served thereby They would like by all mean   to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness I   mean after COMFORT and FASHION and in the highest instance a seat in   Parliament is at the same time the true path of virtue in fact that   in so far a there ha been virtue in the world hitherto it ha   just consisted in such striving Not one of those ponderous   consciencestricken herdinganimals who undertake to advocate the   cause of egoism a conducive to the general welfare want to have   any knowledge or inkling of the fact that the general welfare is   no ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only a   nostrumthat what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another   that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to   higher men in short that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man   and man and consequently between morality and morality They are an   unassuming and fundamentally mediocre specie of men these utilitarian   Englishmen and a already remarked in so far a they are tedious one   can not think highly enough of their utility One ought even to ENCOURAGE   them a ha been partially attempted in the following rhyme         Hail ye worthy

later age which may be proud of their humanity there   still remains so much fear so much SUPERSTITION of the fear of the   cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of   these humaner agesthat even obvious truth a if by the agreement   of century have long remained unuttered because they have the   appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again   I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape let   others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment   FOOTNOTE An expression from Schillers William Tell Act IV Scene   3 to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in it old   cornerOne ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one eye   one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest   gross errorsas for instance have been fostered by ancient and   modern philosopher with regard to tragedymay no longer wander about   virtuously and boldly Almost everything that we call higher culture   is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTYthis is   my thesis the wild beast ha not been slain at all it life it   flourish it ha only beentransfigured That which constitutes the   painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in   socalled tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime   up to the highest and most delicate thrill of metaphysics obtains it   sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty What the   Roman enjoys in the arena the Christian in the ecstasy of the cross   the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bullfight   the presentday Japanese who press his way to the tragedy the workman   of the Parisian suburb who ha a homesickness for bloody revolution   the Wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance of   Tristan and Isoldewhat all these enjoy and strive with mysterious   ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great Circe cruelty Here   to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of   former time which could only teach with regard to cruelty that   it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS there is an   abundant superabundant enjoyment even in one own suffering in   causing one own sufferingand wherever man ha allowed himself to be   persuaded to selfdenial in the RELIGIOUS sense or to selfmutilation   a among the Phoenicians and ascetic or in general to   desensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to Puritanical   repentancespasms to vivisection of conscience and to Pascallike   SACRIFIZIA DELL INTELLETO he is secretly allured and impelled   forward by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS   HIMSELFFinally let u consider that even the seeker of knowledge   operates a an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels his   spirit to perceive AGAINST it own inclination and often enough against   the wish of his hearthe force it to say Nay where he would like   to affirm love and adore indeed every instance of taking a thing   profoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuring   of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aim at   appearance and superficialityeven in every desire for knowledge there   is a drop of cruelty     230 Perhaps what I have said here about a fundamental will of the   spirit may not be understood without further detail I may be allowed   a word of explanationThat imperious something which is popularly   called the spirit wish to be master internally and externally   and to feel itself master it ha the will of a multiplicity for a   simplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will   Its requirement and capacity here are the same a those assigned by   physiologist to everything that life grows and multiplies The power   of the spirit to appropriate foreign element reveals itself in a strong   tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifold   to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just a it   arbitrarily reunderlines make prominent and falsifies for itself   certain trait and line in the foreign element in every portion of   the outside world Its object thereby is the incorporation of new   experience the assortment of new thing in the old arrangementsin   short growth or more properly the FEELING of growth the feeling of   increased poweris it object This same will ha at it service an   apparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preference   of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of window an inner   denial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensive   attitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscurity   with the shuttingin horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance   a that which is all necessary according to the degree of it   appropriating power it digestive power to speak figuratively and   in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else Here   also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be   deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so   but is only allowed to pas a such a delight in uncertainty and   ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary outoftheway narrowness   and mystery of the toonear of the foreground of the magnified   the diminished the misshapen the beautifiedan enjoyment of the   arbitrariness of all these manifestation of power Finally in this   connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to   deceive other spirit and dissemble before themthe constant pressing   and straining of a creating shaping changeable power the spirit   enjoys therein it craftiness and it variety of disguise it enjoys   also it feeling of security thereinit is precisely by it Protean   art that it is best protected and concealedCOUNTER TO this   propensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for a   cloak in short for an outsidefor every outside is a cloakthere   operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which take and   INSISTS on taking thing profoundly variously and thoroughly a a   kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every   courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided a it ought   to be that he ha sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for   introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe   word He will say There is something cruel in the tendency of my   spirit let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not   so In fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps   our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and   glorifiedwe free VERY free spiritsand some day perhaps SUCH will   actually be ourposthumous glory Meanwhilefor there is plenty of   time until thenwe should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in   such florid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work ha   just made u sick of this taste and it sprightly exuberance They are   beautiful glistening jingling festive word honesty love of truth   love of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthfulthere   is something in them that make one heart swell with pride But we   anchorite and marmot have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the   secrecy of an anchorite conscience that this worthy parade of   verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and   golddust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such   flattering colour and repainting the terrible original text HOMO NATURA   must again be recognized In effect to translate man back again into   nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretation and   subordinate meaning which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over   the eternal original text HOMO NATURA to bring it about that man shall   henceforth stand before man a he now hardened by the discipline   of science stand before the OTHER form of nature with fearless   Oedipuseyes and stopped Ulyssesears deaf to the enticement of old   metaphysical birdcatchers who have piped to him far too long Thou   art more thou art higher thou hast a different originthis may be   a strange and foolish task but that it is a TASK who can deny Why did   we choose it this foolish task Or to put the question differently   Why knowledge at all Every one will ask u about this And thus   pressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred time have   not found and can not find any better answer     231 Learning alters u it doe what all nourishment doe that doe not   merely conserveas the physiologist know But at the bottom of our   soul quite down below there is certainly something unteachable   a granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to   predetermined chosen question In each cardinal problem there speaks   an unchangeable I am this a thinker can not learn anew about man and   woman for instance but can only learn fullyhe can only follow to the   end what is fixed about them in himself Occasionally we find certain   solution of problem which make strong belief for u perhaps they   are henceforth called conviction Later onone see in them only   footstep to selfknowledge guidepost to the problem which we   ourselves AREor more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody   our spiritual fate the UNTEACHABLE in u quite down belowIn view   of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself permission   will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truth about   woman a she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally   they are merelyMY truth     232 Woman wish to be independent and therefore she begin to   enlighten men about woman a she isTHIS is one of the worst   development of the general UGLIFYING of Europe For what must these   clumsy attempt of feminine scientificality and selfexposure bring   to light Woman ha so much cause for shame in woman there is so   much pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumption   unbridledness and indiscretion concealedstudy only woman behaviour   towards childrenwhich ha really been best restrained and dominated   hitherto by the FEAR of man Alas if ever the eternally tedious in   womanshe ha plenty of itis allowed to venture forth if she   begin radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and artof   charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and   taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable   desire Female voice are already raised which by Saint Aristophanes   make one afraidwith medical explicitness it is stated in a   threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man Is   it not in the very worst taste that woman thus set herself up to be   scientific Enlightenment hitherto ha fortunately been men affair   men giftwe remained therewith among ourselves and in the end   in view of all that woman write about woman we may well have   considerable doubt a to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment   about herselfand CAN desire it If woman doe not thereby seek a new   ORNAMENT for herselfI believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally   femininewhy then she wish to make herself feared perhaps she   thereby wish to get the mastery But she doe not want truthwhat   doe woman care for truth From the very first nothing is more foreign   more repugnant or more hostile to woman than truthher great art is   falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty Let u confess   it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in   woman we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek the   company of being under whose hand glance and delicate folly our   seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like folly to   u Finally I ask the question Did a woman herself ever acknowledge   profundity in a woman mind or justice in a woman heart And is it   not true that on the whole woman ha hitherto been most despised by   woman herself and not at all by usWe men desire that woman should   not continue to compromise herself by enlightening u just a it wa   man care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed   mulier taceat in ecclesia It wa to the benefit of woman when Napoleon   gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand mulier taceat in   politicisand in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who call   out to woman today mulier taceat de mulierel     233 It betrays corruption of the instinctsapart from the fact that   it betrays bad tastewhen a woman refers to Madame Roland or Madame de   Stael or Monsieur George Sand a though something were proved thereby   in favour of woman a she is Among men these are the three comical   woman a they arenothing moreand just the best involuntary   counterargument against feminine emancipation and autonomy     234 Stupidity in the kitchen woman a cook the terrible   thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of   the house is managed Woman doe not understand what food mean and she   insists on being cook If woman had been a thinking creature she should   certainly a cook for thousand of year have discovered the most   important physiological fact and should likewise have got possession   of the healing art Through bad female cooksthrough the entire lack   of reason in the kitchenthe development of mankind ha been longest   retarded and most interfered with even today matter are very little   better A word to High School girl     235 There are turn and cast of fancy there are sentence little   handful of word in which a whole culture a whole society suddenly   crystallises itself Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de   Lambert to her son MON AMI NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES   QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIRthe motherliest and wisest remark by   the way that wa ever addressed to a son     236 I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and   Goethe believed about womanthe former when he sang ELLA GUARDAVA   SUSO ED IO IN LEI and the latter when he interpreted it the   eternally feminine draw u ALOFT for THIS is just what she belief   of the eternally masculine     237     SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN     How the longest ennui flees When a man come to our knee

treated by men like bird which losing   their way have come down among them from an elevation a something   delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animatingbut a something   also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away     238 To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman to   deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally   hostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal right equal   training equal claim and obligation that is a TYPICAL sign of   shallowmindedness and a thinker who ha proved himself shallow at   this dangerous spotshallow in instinctmay generally be regarded a   suspicious nay more a betrayed a discovered he will probably prove   too short for all fundamental question of life future a well a   present and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depth On the   other hand a man who ha depth of spirit a well a of desire and   ha also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and   harshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman a   ORIENTALS do he must conceive of her a a possession a confinable   property a a being predestined for service and accomplishing her   mission thereinhe must take his stand in this matter upon the immense   rationality of Asia upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia a   the Greeks did formerly those best heir and scholar of Asiawho   a is well known with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power   from Homer to the time of Pericles became gradually STRICTER towards   woman in short more Oriental HOW necessary HOW logical even HOW   humanely desirable this wa let u consider for ourselves     239 The weaker sex ha in no previous age been treated with so   much respect by men a at presentthis belongs to the tendency and   fundamental taste of democracy in the same way a disrespectfulness to   old agewhat wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of   this respect They want more they learn to make claim the tribute   of respect is at last felt to be wellnigh galling rivalry for right   indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in a word woman is   losing modesty And let u immediately add that she is also losing   taste She is unlearning to FEAR man but the woman who unlearns to   fear sacrifice her most womanly instinct That woman should venture   forward when the fearinspiring quality in manor more definitely   the MAN in manis no longer either desired or fully developed is   reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difficult   to understand is that precisely therebywoman deteriorates This is   what is happening nowadays let u not deceive ourselves about it   Wherever the industrial spirit ha triumphed over the military   and aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legal   independence of a clerk woman a clerkess is inscribed on the portal   of the modern society which is in course of formation While she   thus appropriates new right aspires to be master and inscribes   progress of woman on her flag and banner the very opposite realises   itself with terrible obviousness WOMAN RETROGRADES Since the French   Revolution the influence of woman in Europe ha DECLINED in proportion   a she ha increased her right and claim and the emancipation of   woman insofar a it is desired and demanded by woman themselves and   not only by masculine shallowpates thus prof to be a remarkable   symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly   instinct There is STUPIDITY in this movement an almost masculine   stupidity of which a wellreared womanwho is always a sensible   womanmight be heartily ashamed To lose the intuition a to the ground   upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in   the use of her proper weapon to letherselfgo before man perhaps   even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in   refined artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man   faith in a VEILED fundamentally different ideal in woman something   eternally necessarily feminine to emphatically and loquaciously   dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared for   protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and   often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of   everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of   woman in the hitherto existing order of society ha entailed and still   entail a though slavery were a counterargument and not rather a   condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culturewhat   doe all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instinct   a defeminising Certainly there are enough of idiotic friend and   corrupters of woman among the learned ass of the masculine sex who   advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate   all the stupidity from which man in Europe European manliness   sufferswho would like to lower woman to general culture indeed   even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics Here and there   they wish even to make woman into free spirit and literary worker a   though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious   or ludicrous to a profound and godless manalmost everywhere her   nerve are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music   our latest German music and she is daily being made more hysterical   and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that of   bearing robust child They wish to cultivate her in general still   more and intend a they say to make the weaker sex STRONG by   culture a if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that   the cultivating of mankind and his weakeningthat is to say the   weakening dissipating and languishing of his FORCE OF WILLhave   always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and   influential woman in the world and lastly the mother of Napoleon   had just to thank their force of willand not their schoolmastersfor   their power and ascendancy over men That which inspires respect   in woman and often enough fear also is her NATURE which is more   natural than that of man her genuine carnivoralike cunning   flexibility her tigerclaws beneath the glove her NAIVETE in egoism   her untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensibleness   extent and deviation of her desire and virtue That which in spite   of fear excites one sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat   woman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable more   necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any   other creature Fear and sympathy it is with these feeling that man ha   hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in   tragedy which rends while it delightsWhat And all that is now to   be at an end And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress The   tediousness of woman is slowly evolving Oh Europe Europe We know   the horned animal which wa always most attractive to thee from which   danger is ever again threatening thee Thy old fable might once more   become historyan immense stupidity might once again overmaster   thee and carry thee away And no God concealed beneath itno only an   idea a modern idea         CHAPTER VIII PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES       240 I HEARD once again for the first time Richard Wagners overture   to the Mastersinger it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavy   latterday art which ha the pride to presuppose two century of music   a still living in order that it may be understoodit is an honour   to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate What flavour   and force what season and clime do we not find mingled in it It   impress u at one time a ancient at another time a foreign bitter   and too modern it is a arbitrary a it is pompously traditional it   is not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarseit ha fire   and courage and at the same time the loose duncoloured skin of fruit   which ripen too late It flow broad and full and suddenly there is a   moment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that open between cause   and effect an oppression that make u dream almost a nightmare but   already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delightthe most   manifold delightof old and new happiness including ESPECIALLY   the joy of the artist in himself which he refuse to conceal his   astonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedient here   employed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedient of art   which he apparently betrays to u All in all however no beauty no   South nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothing   of grace no dance hardly a will to logic a certain clumsiness even   which is also emphasized a though the artist wished to say to u It   is part of my intention a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarily   barbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceit   and witticism something German in the best and worst sense of   the word something in the German style manifold formless and   inexhaustible a certain German potency and superplenitude of   soul which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of   decadencewhich perhaps feel itself most at ease there a real   genuine token of the German soul which is at the same time young and   aged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity This kind of music   express best what I think of the Germans they belong to the day   before yesterday and the day after tomorrowTHEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY     241 We good Europeans we also have hour when we allow ourselves a   warmhearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old love and narrow   viewsI have just given an example of ithours of national excitement   of patriotic anguish and all other sort of oldfashioned flood of   sentiment Duller spirit may perhaps only get done with what confines   it operation in u to hour and play itself out in hoursin a   considerable time some in half a year others in half a lifetime   according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change   their material Indeed I could think of sluggish hesitating race   which even in our rapidly moving Europe would require half a century   ere they could surmount such atavistic attack of patriotism and   soilattachment and return once more to reason that is to say to   good Europeanism And while digressing on this possibility I   happen to become an earwitness of a conversation between two old   patriotsthey were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently   spoke all the louder HE ha a much and know a much philosophy a   a peasant or a corpsstudent said the onehe is still innocent But   what doe that matter nowadays It is the age of the mass they lie on   their belly before everything that is massive And so also in politicis   A statesman who rear up for them a new Tower of Babel some monstrosity   of empire and power they call greatwhat doe it matter that we more   prudent and conservative one do not meanwhile give up the old belief   that it is only the great thought that give greatness to an action or   affair Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position   of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which they   were by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would have   to sacrifice their old and reliable virtue out of love to a new and   doubtful mediocritysupposing a statesman were to condemn his people   generally to practise politics when they have hitherto had something   better to do and think about and when in the depth of their soul   they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of   the restlessness emptiness and noisy wrangling of the essentially   politicspractising nationssupposing such a statesman were to   stimulate the slumbering passion and avidity of his people were to   make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness   an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were to   depreciate their most radical proclivity subvert their conscience   make their mind narrow and their taste nationalwhat a statesman   who should do all this which his people would have to do penance for   throughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesman   would be GREAT would heUndoubtedly replied the other old patriot   vehemently otherwise he COULD NOT have done it It wa mad perhaps to   wish such a thing But perhaps everything great ha been just a mad   at it commencementMisuse of word cried his interlocutor   contradictorilystrong strong Strong and mad NOT greatThe old   men had obviously become heated a they thus shouted their truth in   each others face but I in my happiness and apartness considered how   soon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also that   there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a   nationnamely in the deepening of another     242 Whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress   which now distinguishes the European whether we call it simply without   praise or blame by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in   Europebehind all the moral and political foreground pointed to by   such formula an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS go on which is ever   extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans their   increasing detachment from the condition under which climatically and   hereditarily united race originate their increasing independence of   every definite milieu that for century would fain inscribe itself   with equal demand on soul and bodythat is to say the slow emergence   of an essentially SUPERNATIONAL and nomadic specie of man who   posse physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and power   of adaptation a his typical distinction This process of the EVOLVING   EUROPEAN which can be retarded in it TEMPO by great relapse but   will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depththe   stillraging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it   and also the anarchism which is appearing at presentthis process   will probably arrive at result on which it naive propagator and   panegyrist the apostle of modern idea would least care to reckon   The same new condition under which on an average a levelling and   mediocrising of man will take placea useful industrious variously   serviceable and clever gregarious manare in the highest degree   suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and   attractive quality For while the capacity for adaptation which is   every day trying changing condition and begin a new work with every   generation almost with every decade make the POWERFULNESS of the type   impossible while the collective impression of such future Europeans   will probably be that of numerous talkative weakwilled and very   handy workman who REQUIRE a master a commander a they require their   daily bread while therefore the democratising of Europe will tend to   the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle   sense of the term the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and   exceptional case become stronger and richer than he ha perhaps ever   been beforeowing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to   the immense variety of practice art and disguise I meant to say   that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary   arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTStaking the word in all it   meaning even in it most spiritual sense     243 I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the   constellation Hercules and I hope that the men on this earth will do   like the sun And we foremost we good Europeans     244 There wa a time when it wa customary to call Germans deep   by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new   Germanism is covetous of quite other honour and perhaps miss   smartness in all that ha depth it is almost opportune and patriotic   to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that   commendation in short whether German depth is not at bottom something   different and worseand something from which thank God we are on the   point of successfully ridding ourselves Let u try then to relearn   with regard to German depth the only thing necessary for the purpose is   a little vivisection of the German soulThe German soul is above all   manifold varied in it source aggregated and superimposed rather   than actually built this is owing to it origin A German who would   embolden himself to assert Two soul ala dwell in my breast would   make a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far   short of the truth about the number of soul As a people made up of   the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of race perhaps even with a   preponderance of the preAryan element a the people of the centre in   every sense of the term the Germans are more intangible more ample   more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising   and even more terrifying than other people are to themselvesthey   escape DEFINITION and are thereby alone the despair of the French It   IS characteristic of the Germans that the question What is German   never dy out among them Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well   enough We are known they cried jubilantly to himbut Sand also   thought he knew them Jean Paul knew what he wa doing when he declared   himself incensed at Fichtes lying but patriotic flattery and   exaggerationsbut it is probable that Goethe thought differently about   Germans from Jean Paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with   regard to Fichte It is a question what Goethe really thought about the   GermansBut about many thing around him he never spoke explicitly   and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silenceprobably he   had good reason for it It is certain that it wa not the Wars of   Independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it wa   the French Revolutionthe event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED   his Faust and indeed the whole problem of man wa the appearance   of Napoleon There are word of Goethe in which he condemns with   impatient severity a from a foreign land that which Germans take a   pride in he once defined the famous German turn of mind a Indulgence   towards it own and others weakness Was he wrong it is   characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them   The German soul ha passage and gallery in it there are cave   hidingplaces and dungeon therein it disorder ha much of the charm   of the mysterious the German is well acquainted with the bypath to   chaos And a everything love it symbol so the German love the   cloud and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and   shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped   selfdisplacing and growing is deep The German himself doe not   EXIST he is BECOMING he is developing himself Development is   therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain   of philosophical formulasa ruling idea which together with German   beer and German music is labouring to Germanise all Europe Foreigners   are astonished and attracted by the riddle which the conflicting nature   at the basis of the German soul propounds to them riddle which   Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner ha in the end set to music   Goodnatured and spitefulsuch a juxtaposition preposterous in the   case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justified   in Germany one ha only to live for a while among Swabians to know this   The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness   agree alarmingly well with his physical ropedancing and nimble   boldness of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid If any one   wish to see the German soul demonstrated ad oculos let him   only look at German taste at German art and manner what boorish   indifference to taste How the noblest and the commonest stand there   in juxtaposition How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution   of this soul The German DRAGS at his soul he drag at everything he   experience He digest his event badly he never get done   with them and German depth is often only a difficult hesitating   digestion And just a all chronic invalid all dyspeptic like what   is convenient so the German love frankness and honesty it is   so CONVENIENT to be frank and honestThis confidingness this   complaisance this showingthecards of German HONESTY is probably the   most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to   nowadays it is his proper Mephistophelean art with this he can still   achieve much The German let himself go and thereby gaze with   faithful blue empty German eyesand other country immediately   confound him with his dressinggownI meant to say that let German   depth be what it willamong ourselves alone we perhaps take the   liberty to laugh at itwe shall do well to continue henceforth to   honour it appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our   old reputation a a people of depth for Prussian smartness and   Berlin wit and sand It is wise for a people to pose and LET itself   be regarded a profound clumsy goodnatured honest and foolish it   might even beprofound to do so Finally we should do honour to   our namewe are not called the TIUSCHE VOLK deceptive people for   nothing     245 The good old time is past it sang itself out in Mozarthow   happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to u that his good   company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the Chinese and   it flourish his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant the   amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the South can   still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in u Ah some time or other it will be   over with itbut who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with   the intelligence and taste for Beethoven For he wa only the last echo   of a break and transition in style and NOT like Mozart the last echo   of a great European taste which had existed for century Beethoven   is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly   breaking down and a future overyoung soul that is always COMING   there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal   extravagant hopethe same light in which Europe wa bathed when it   dreamed with Rousseau when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the   Revolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon   But how rapidly doe THIS very sentiment now pale how difficult   nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment how strangely doe   the language of Rousseau Schiller Shelley and Byron sound to our ear   in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe wa able to SPEAK which   knew how to SING in BeethovenWhatever German music came afterwards   belongs to Romanticism that is to say to a movement which   historically considered wa still shorter more fleeting and more   superficial than that great interlude the transition of Europe from   Rousseau to Napoleon and to the rise of democracy Weberbut what do   WE care nowadays for Freischutz and Oberon Or Marschners Hans   Heiling and Vampyre Or even Wagners Tannhauser That is extinct   although not yet forgotten music This whole music of Romanticism   besides wa not noble enough wa not musical enough to maintain it   position anywhere but in the theatre and before the mass from the   beginning it wa secondrate music which wa little thought of by   genuine musician It wa different with Felix Mendelssohn that halcyon   master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly   acquired admiration and wa equally quickly forgotten a the beautiful   EPISODE of German music But with regard to Robert Schumann who took   thing seriously and ha been taken seriously from the firsthe   wa the last that founded a schooldo we not now regard it a a   satisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very Romanticism   of Schumanns ha been surmounted Schumann fleeing into the Saxon   Switzerland of his soul with a half Wertherlike half JeanPaullike   nature assuredly not like Beethoven assuredly not like Byronhis   MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of   injustice Schumann with his taste which wa fundamentally a PETTY   taste that is to say a dangerous propensitydoubly dangerous among   Germansfor quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feeling going   constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling who   revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning   a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGEREthis Schumann wa already merely a   GERMAN event in music and no longer a European event a Beethoven had   been a in a still greater degree Mozart had been with Schumann German   music wa threatened with it greatest danger that of LOSING THE VOICE   FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair     246 What a torture are book written in German to a reader who ha a   THIRD ear How indignantly he stand beside the slowly turning swamp   of sound without tune and rhythm without dance which Germans call   a book And even the German who READS book How lazily how   reluctantly how badly he read How many Germans know and consider it   obligatory to know that there is ART in every good sentenceart which   must be divined if the sentence is to be understood If there is a   misunderstanding about it TEMPO for instance the sentence itself   is misunderstood That one must not be doubtful about the   rhythmdetermining syllable that one should feel the breaking of the   toorigid symmetry a intentional and a a charm that one should lend a   fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO that one should   divine the sense in the sequence of the vowel and diphthong and how   delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of   their arrangementwho among bookreading Germans is complaisant enough   to recognize such duty and requirement and to listen to so much art   and intention in language After all one just ha no ear for it   and so the most marked contrast of style are not heard and the most   delicate artistry is a it were SQUANDERED on the deafThese were my   thought when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two master in   the art of prosewriting have been confounded one whose word drop   down hesitatingly and coldly a from the roof of a damp cavehe count   on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language   like a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toe feel the   dangerous bliss of the quivering oversharp blade which wish to   bite hiss and cut     247 How little the German style ha to do with harmony and with the   ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musician themselves   write badly The German doe not read aloud he doe not read for the   ear but only with his eye he ha put his ear away in the drawer for   the time In antiquity when a man readwhich wa seldom enoughhe read   something to himself and in a loud voice they were surprised when   any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it In a   loud voice that is to say with all the swelling inflection and   variation of key and change of TEMPO in which the ancient PUBLIC   world took delight The law of the written style were then the same   a those of the spoken style and these law depended partly on the   surprising development and refined requirement of the ear and larynx   partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lung In   the ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuch   a it is comprised in one breath Such period a occur in Demosthenes   and Cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath   were pleasure to the men of ANTIQUITY who knew by their own schooling   how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficulty   in the deliverance of such a periodWE have really no right to the   BIG period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense Those   ancient indeed were all of them dilettante in speaking consequently   connoisseur consequently criticsthey thus brought their orator to   the highest pitch in the same manner a in the last century when all   Italian lady and gentleman knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song   and with it also the art of melody reached it elevation In Germany   however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began   shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter it young wing there wa   properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical   discoursethat delivered from the pulpit The preacher wa the only one   in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner a   sentence strike spring rush flow and come to a close he alone   had a conscience in his ear often enough a bad conscience for reason   are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom   attained by a German or almost always too late The masterpiece of   German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of it   greatest preacher the BIBLE ha hitherto been the best German   book Compared with Luthers Bible almost everything else is merely   literaturesomething which ha not grown in Germany and therefore   ha not taken and doe not take root in German heart a the Bible ha   done     248 There are two kind of genius one which above all engenders and   seek to engender and another which willingly let itself be fructified   and brings forth And similarly among the gifted nation there are   those on whom the woman problem of pregnancy ha devolved and the   secret task of forming maturing and perfectingthe Greeks for   instance were a nation of this kind and so are the French and others   which have to fructify and become the cause of new mode of lifelike   the Jews the Romans and in all modesty be it asked like the   Germansnations tortured and enraptured by unknown fever and   irresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing for   foreign race for such a let themselves be fructified and withal   imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force   and consequently empowered by the grace of God These two kind of   genius seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand   each otherlike man and woman     249 Every nation ha it own Tartuffery and call that it   virtueOne doe not knowcannot know the best that is in one     250 What Europe owes to the JewsMany thing good and bad and above   all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand   style in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demand of   infinite signification the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral   questionablenessand consequently just the most attractive ensnaring   and exquisite element in those iridescence and allurement to life   in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture it evening   sky now glowsperhaps glow out For this we artist among the   spectator and philosopher aregrateful to the Jews     251 It must be taken into the bargain if various cloud and   disturbancesin short slight attack of stupiditypass over the   spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national   nervous fever and political ambition for instance among presentday   Germans there is alternately the antiFrench folly the antiSemitic   folly the antiPolish folly the Christianromantic folly the   Wagnerian folly the Teutonic folly the Prussian folly just look at   those poor historian the Sybels and Treitschkes and their closely   bandaged head and whatever else these little obscurations of the   German spirit and conscience may be called May it be forgiven me that   I too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not   remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began   to entertain thought about matter which did not concern methe first   symptom of political infection About the Jews for instance listen   to the followingI have never yet met a German who wa favourably   inclined to the Jews and however decided the repudiation of actual   antiSemitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men this   prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the   sentiment itself but only against it dangerous excess and especially   against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of   sentimenton this point we must not deceive ourselves That Germany   ha amply SUFFICIENT Jews that the German stomach the German blood   ha difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of this   quantity of Jewas the Italian the Frenchman and the Englishman   have done by mean of a stronger digestionthat is the unmistakable   declaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listen   and according to which one must act Let no more Jews come in And shut   the door especially towards the East also towards Austriathus   command the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and   uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by   a stronger race The Jews however are beyond all doubt the strongest   toughest and purest race at present living in Europe they know how   to succeed even under the worst condition in fact better than under   favourable one by mean of virtue of some sort which one would like   nowadays to label a vicesowing above all to a resolute faith which   doe not need to be ashamed before modern idea they alter only   WHEN they do alter in the same way that the Russian Empire make   it conquestas an empire that ha plenty of time and is not of   yesterdaynamely according to the principle a slowly a possible   A thinker who ha the future of Europe at heart will in all his   perspective concerning the future calculate upon the Jews a he   will calculate upon the Russians a above all the surest and likeliest   factor in the great play and battle of force That which is at present   called a nation in Europe and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA   indeed sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA is in   every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet   a race much le such a race AERE PERENNUS a the Jews are such   nation should most carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and   hostility It is certain that the Jews if they desiredor if they   were driven to it a the antiSemites seem to wishCOULD now have the   ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over Europe that they are NOT   working and planning for that end is equally certain Meanwhile they   rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and   absorbed by Europe they long to be finally settled authorized and   respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the   wandering Jewand one should certainly take account of this impulse   and tendency and MAKE ADVANCES to it it possibly betokens a mitigation   of the Jewish instinct for which purpose it would perhaps be useful   and fair to banish the antiSemitic bawler out of the country One   should make advance with all prudence and with selection pretty much   a the English nobility do It stand to reason that the more powerful   and strongly marked type of new Germanism could enter into relation   with the Jews with the least hesitation for instance the nobleman   officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many way   to see whether the genius for money and patience and especially some   intellect and intellectualitysadly lacking in the place referred to   could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of   commanding and obeyingfor both of which the country in question ha   now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal   discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my   SERIOUS TOPIC the European problem a I understand it the rearing   of a new ruling caste for Europe     252 They are not a philosophical racethe English Bacon represents an   ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally Hobbes Hume and Locke   an abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more   than a century It wa AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself   it wa Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said JE MEPRISE LOCKE in the   struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world   Hegel and Schopenhauer along with Goethe were of one accord the   two hostile brothergeniuses in philosophy who pushed in different   direction towards the opposite pole of German thought and thereby   wronged each other a only brother will doWhat is lacking in   England and ha always been lacking that halfactor and rhetorician   knew well enough the absurd muddlehead Carlyle who sought to conceal   under passionate grimace what he knew about himself namely what wa   LACKING in Carlylereal POWER of intellect real DEPTH of intellectual   perception in short philosophy It is characteristic of such an   unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianitythey NEED it   discipline for moralizing and humanizing The Englishman more gloomy   sensual headstrong and brutal than the Germanis for that very   reason a the baser of the two also the most pious he ha all the   MORE NEED of Christianity To finer nostril this English Christianity   itself ha still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic   excess for which owing to good reason it is used a an antidotethe   finer poison to neutralize the coarser a finer form of poisoning is   in fact a step in advance with coarsemannered people a step towards   spiritualization The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still   most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime and by praying   and psalmsinging or more correctly it is thereby explained and   differently expressed and for the herd of drunkard and rake who   formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism and   more recently a the Salvation Army a penitential fit may really be   the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can   be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted That however which   offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music to speak   figuratively and also literally he ha neither rhythm nor dance in   the movement of his soul and body indeed not even the desire for   rhythm and dance for music Listen to him speaking look at the most   beautiful Englishwoman WALKINGin no country on earth are there more   beautiful dove and swan finally listen to them singing But I ask   too much     253 There are truth which are best recognized by mediocre mind   because they are best adapted for them there are truth which only   posse charm and seductive power for mediocre spiritsone is pushed   to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence of   respectable but mediocre EnglishmenI may mention Darwin John   Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencerbegins to gain the ascendancy in the   middleclass region of European taste Indeed who could doubt that it   is a useful thing for SUCH mind to have the ascendancy for a time It   would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently   soaring mind a specially qualified for determining and collecting many   little common fact and deducing conclusion from them a exception   they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards   those who are the rule After all they have more to do than merely   to perceivein effect they have to BE something new they have to   SIGNIFY something new they have to REPRESENT new value The gulf   between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more   mysterious than one think the capable man in the grand style the   creator will possibly have to be an ignorant personwhile on the   other hand for scientific discovery like those of Darwin a certain   narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something   English may not be unfavourable for arriving at themFinally let   it not be forgotten that the English with their profound mediocrity   brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence     What is called modern idea or the idea of the eighteenth century   or French ideasthat consequently against which the GERMAN mind   rose up with profound disgustis of English origin there is no doubt   about it The French were only the ape and actor of these idea their   best soldier and likewise ala their first and profoundest VICTIMS   for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of modern idea the AME   FRANCAIS ha in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present   one recall it sixteenth and seventeenth century it profound   passionate strength it inventive excellency almost with disbelief   One must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in   a determined manner and defend it against present prejudice and   appearance the European NOBLESSEof sentiment taste and manner   taking the word in every high senseis the work and invention of   FRANCE the European ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideasis   ENGLANDS work and invention     254 Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual   and refined culture of Europe it is still the high school of taste but   one must know how to find this France of taste He who belongs to it   keep himself well concealedthey may be a small number in whom it   life and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon   the strongest leg in part fatalist hypochondriac invalid in   part person overindulged overrefined such a have the AMBITION to   conceal themselves     They have all something in common they keep their ear closed in   presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic   BOURGEOIS In fact a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawl   in the foregroundit recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste   and at the same time of selfadmiration at the funeral of Victor Hugo   There is also something else common to them a predilection to resist   intellectual Germanizingand a still greater inability to do so   In this France of intellect which is also a France of pessimism   Schopenhauer ha perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than   he ha ever been in Germany not to speak of Heinrich Heine who ha   long ago been reincarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrist   of Paris or of Hegel who at present in the form of Tainethe FIRST   of living historiansexercises an almost tyrannical influence As   regard Richard Wagner however the more French music learns to   adapt itself to the actual need of the AME MODERNE the more will it   Wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehandit is already   taking place sufficiently There are however three thing which the   French can still boast of with pride a their heritage and possession   and a indelible token of their ancient intellectual superiority   in Europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and   vulgarizing of taste FIRSTLY the capacity for artistic emotion for   devotion to form for which the expression LART POUR LART along   with numerous others ha been inventedsuch capacity ha not been   lacking in France for three century and owing to it reverence for   the small number it ha again and again made a sort of chamber   music of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewhere   in EuropeThe SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to   a superiority over Europe is their ancient manysided MORALISTIC   culture owing to which one find on an average even in the petty   ROMANCIERS of the newspaper and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS a   psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example one   ha no conception to say nothing of the thing itself in Germany   The Germans lack a couple of century of the moralistic work requisite   thereto which a we have said France ha not grudged those who call   the Germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect   As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE   PSYCHOLOGICA which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness   of German intercourseand a the most successful expression of   genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate   thrill Henri Beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and   forerunning man who with a Napoleonic TEMPO traversed HIS Europe   in fact several century of the European soul a a surveyor and   discoverer thereofit ha required two generation to OVERTAKE him   one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddle   that perplexed and enraptured himthis strange Epicurean and man of   interrogation the last great psychologist of FranceThere is yet   a THIRD claim to superiority in the French character there is a   successful halfway synthesis of the North and South which make them   comprehend many thing and enjoins upon them other thing which an   Englishman can never comprehend Their temperament turned alternately   to and from the South in which from time to time the Provencal and   Ligurian blood froth over preserve them from the dreadful northern   greyingrey from sunless conceptualspectrism and from poverty of   bloodour GERMAN infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalence   of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high   politics ha with great resolution been prescribed according to   a dangerous healing art which bid me wait and wait but not yet   hopeThere is also still in France a preunderstanding and   ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are too   comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and   know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the   Souththe born Midlanders the good Europeans For them BIZET   ha made music this latest genius who ha seen a new beauty and   seductionwho ha discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC     255 I hold that many precaution should be taken against German music   Suppose a person love the South a I love itas a great school   of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ill a a   boundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereign   existence believing in itselfwell such a person will learn to be   somewhat on his guard against German music because in injuring his   taste anew it will also injure his health anew Such a Southerner a   Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF if he should dream of the future   of music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the   North and must have in his ear the prelude to a deeper mightier and   perhaps more perverse and mysterious music a superGerman music which   doe not fade pale and die away a all German music doe at the   sight of the blue wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of skya   superEuropean music which hold it own even in presence of the brown   sunset of the desert whose soul is akin to the palmtree and can be   at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beast of prey I   could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew   nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some   sailor homesickness some golden shadow and tender weakness might   sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see   the colour of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing   towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to   receive such belated fugitive     256 Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationalitycraze ha   induced and still induces among the nation of Europe owing also to the   shortsighted and hastyhanded politician who with the help of this   craze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent the   disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude   policyowing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable   at present the most unmistakable sign that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE   are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted With all   the more profound and largeminded men of this century the real general   tendency of the mysterious labour of their soul wa to prepare the way   for that new SYNTHESIS and tentatively to anticipate the European of   the future only in their simulation or in their weaker moment in   old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlandsthey only rested   from themselves when they became patriot I think of such men a   Napoleon Goethe Beethoven Stendhal Heinrich Heine Schopenhauer it   must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them about   whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstanding   genius like him have seldom the right to understand themselves   still le of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now   resisted and opposed in France the fact remains nevertheless that   Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forty are   most closely and intimately related to one another They are akin   fundamentally akin in all the height and depth of their requirement   it is Europe the ONE Europe whose soul press urgently and longingly   outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous artwhither   into a new light towards a new sun But who would attempt to express   accurately what all these master of new mode of speech could not   express distinctly It is certain that the same storm and stress   tormented them that they SOUGHT in the same manner these last great   seeker All of

Let the German friend of Richard Wagner advise together a to   whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art or whether   it distinction doe not consist precisely in coming from SUPERGERMAN   source and impulse in which connection it may not be underrated   how indispensable Paris wa to the development of his type which the   strength of his instinct made him long to visit at the most   decisive timeand how the whole style of his proceeding of his   selfapostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the French   socialistic original On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be   found to the honour of Richard Wagners German nature that he ha   acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation   than a nineteenthcentury Frenchman could have doneowing to the   circumstance that we Germans are a yet nearer to barbarism than the   Frenchperhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is   not only at present but for ever

ANTICATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow   civilized nation He may even have been a sin against Romanticism this   antiLatin Siegfried well Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old   sad day

what ye hear is ROMEROMES FAITH BY INTUITION         CHAPTER IX WHAT IS NOBLE       257 EVERY elevation of the type man ha hitherto been the work of an   aristocratic society and so it will always bea society believing in   a long scale of gradation of rank and difference of worth among human   being and requiring slavery in some form or other Without the PATHOS   OF DISTANCE such a grows out of the incarnated difference of class   out of the constant outlooking and downlooking of the ruling caste on   subordinate and instrument and out of their equally constant   practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a   distancethat other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the   longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself   the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more   comprehensive state in short just the elevation of the type man   the continued selfsurmounting of man to use a moral formula in   a supermoral sense To be sure one must not resign oneself to   any humanitarian illusion about the history of the origin of an   aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition for   the elevation of the type man the truth is hard Let u acknowledge   unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto ha ORIGINATED   Men with a still natural nature barbarian in every terrible sense of   the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will   and desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more   peaceful race perhaps trading or cattlerearing community or upon   old mellow civilization in which the final vital force wa flickering   out in brilliant firework of wit and depravity At the commencement   the noble caste wa always the barbarian caste their superiority did   not consist first of all in their physical but in their psychical   powerthey were more COMPLETE men which at every point also implies   the same a more complete beast     258 Corruptionas the indication that anarchy threatens to break out   among the instinct and that the foundation of the emotion called   life is convulsedis something radically different according to   the organization in which it manifest itself When for instance an   aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution   flung away it privilege with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself   to an excess of it moral sentiment it wa corruptionit wa really   only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for century   by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step it   lordly prerogative and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty in   the end even to it decoration and paradedress The essential thing   however in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard   itself a a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but   a the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereofthat it should   therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion   of individual who FOR ITS SAKE must be suppressed and reduced to   imperfect men to slave and instrument Its fundamental belief must   be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for it own sake but   only a a foundation and scaffolding by mean of which a select class   of being may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duty and   in general to a higher EXISTENCE like those sunseeking climbing plant   in Javathey are called Sipo Matadorwhich encircle an oak so   long and so often with their arm until at last high above it but   supported by it they can unfold their top in the open light and   exhibit their happiness     259 To refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitation   and put one will on a par with that of others this may result in a   certain rough sense in good conduct among individual when the necessary   condition are given namely the actual similarity of the individual   in amount of force and degree of worth and their corelation within one   organization As soon however a one wished to take this principle   more generally and if possible even a the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF   SOCIETY it would immediately disclose what it really isnamely a Will   to the DENIAL of life a principle of dissolution and decay Here one   must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental   weakness life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation injury conquest   of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of   peculiar form incorporation and at the least putting it mildest   exploitationbut why should one for ever use precisely these word   on which for age a disparaging purpose ha been stamped Even the   organization within which a wa previously supposed the   individual treat each other a equalit take place in every   healthy aristocracymust itself if it be a living and not a dying   organization do all that towards other body which the individual   within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the   incarnated Will to Power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground   attract to itself and acquire ascendancynot owing to any morality or   immorality but because it LIVES and because life IS precisely Will to   Power On no point however is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans   more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave   everywhere even under the guise of science about coming condition of   society in which the exploiting character is to be absentthat sound   to my ear a if they promised to invent a mode of life which should   refrain from all organic function Exploitation doe not belong to a   depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of   the living being a a primary organic function it is a consequence   of the intrinsic Will to Power which is precisely the Will to   LifeGranting that a a theory this is a noveltyas a reality it is   the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let u be so far honest towards   ourselves     260 In a tour through the many finer and coarser morality which have   hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth I found certain trait   recurring regularly together and connected with one another until   finally two primary type revealed themselves to me and a radical   distinction wa brought to light There is MASTERMORALITY and   SLAVEMORALITYI would at once add however that in all higher and   mixed civilization there are also attempt at the reconciliation of   the two morality but one find still oftener the confusion and   mutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their close   juxtapositioneven in the same man within one soul The distinction   of moral value have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly   conscious of being different from the ruledor among the ruled class   the slave and dependent of all sort In the first case when it is   the ruler who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud   disposition which is regarded a the distinguishing feature and that   which determines the order of rank The noble type of man separate   from himself the being in whom the opposite of this exalted proud   disposition display itself he despises them Let it at once be noted   that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad   mean practically the same a noble and despicablethe antithesis   good and EVIL is of a different origin The cowardly the timid the   insignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised   moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glance the   selfabasing the doglike kind of men who let themselves be abused   the mendicant flatterer and above all the liarsit is a fundamental   belief of all aristocrat that the common people are untruthful We   truthful onesthe nobility in ancient Greece called themselves It is   obvious that everywhere the designation of moral value were at first   applied to MEN and were only derivatively and at a later period applied   to ACTIONS it is a gross mistake therefore when historian of moral   start with question like Why have sympathetic action been praised   The noble type of man regard HIMSELF a a determiner of value he   doe not require to be approved of he pass the judgment What is   injurious to me is injurious in itself he know that it is he himself   only who confers honour on thing he is a CREATOR OF VALUES He   honour whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equal   selfglorification In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude   of power which seek to overflow the happiness of high tension the   consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestowthe noble   man also help the unfortunate but notor scarcelyout of pity but   rather from an impulse generated by the superabundance of power The   noble man honour in himself the powerful one him also who ha power   over himself who know how to speak and how to keep silence who   take pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and ha   reverence for all that is severe and hard Wotan placed a hard heart in   my breast say an old Scandinavian Saga it is thus rightly expressed   from the soul of a proud Viking Such a type of man is even proud of not   being made for sympathy the hero of the Saga therefore add warningly   He who ha not a hard heart when young will never have one The noble   and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality   which see precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of others   or in DESINTERESSEMENT the characteristic of the moral faith   in oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towards   selflessness belong a definitely to noble morality a do a careless   scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heartIt   is the powerful who KNOW how to honour it is their art their domain   for invention The profound reverence for age and for traditionall law   rest on this double reverencethe belief and prejudice in favour of   ancestor and unfavourable to newcomer is typical in the morality of   the powerful and if reversely men of modern idea believe almost   instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more   lacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these idea ha   complacently betrayed itself thereby A morality of the ruling class   however is more especially foreign and irritating to presentday taste   in the sternness of it principle that one ha duty only to one   equal that one may act towards being of a lower rank towards all   that is foreign just a seems good to one or a the heart desire   and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and   similar sentiment can have a place The ability and obligation to   exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revengeboth only within the   circle of equalsartfulness in retaliation RAFFINEMENT of the idea   in friendship a certain necessity to have enemy a outlet for the   emotion of envy quarrelsomeness arrogancein fact in order to be   a good FRIEND all these are typical characteristic of the noble   morality which a ha been pointed out is not the morality of modern   idea and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also to   unearth and discloseIt is otherwise with the second type of morality   SLAVEMORALITY Supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering   the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should   moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimate   Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of   man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with   his situation The slave ha an unfavourable eye for the virtue of the   powerful he ha a skepticism and distrust a REFINEMENT of distrust of   everything good that is there honouredhe would fain persuade himself   that the very happiness there is not genuine On the other hand THOSE   quality which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferer are   brought into prominence and flooded with light it is here that   sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence   humility and friendliness attain to honour for here these are the most   useful quality and almost the only mean of supporting the burden of   existence Slavemorality is essentially the morality of utility   Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and   evilpower and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil   a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of   being despised According to slavemorality therefore the evil man   arouses fear according to mastermorality it is precisely the good   man who arouses fear and seek to arouse it while the bad man is   regarded a the despicable being The contrast attains it maximum when   in accordance with the logical consequence of slavemorality a shade   of depreciationit may be slight and wellintentionedat last attache   itself to the good man of this morality because according to the   servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the SAFE   man he is goodnatured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid un   bonhomme Everywhere that slavemorality gain the ascendancy language   show a tendency to approximate the signification of the word good   and stupidA last fundamental difference the desire for FREEDOM   the instinct for happiness and the refinement of the feeling of liberty   belong a necessarily to slavemorals and morality a artifice and   enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptom of an   aristocratic mode of thinking and estimatingHence we can understand   without further detail why love AS A PASSIONit is our European   specialtymust absolutely be of noble origin a is well known it   invention is due to the Provencal poetcavaliers those brilliant   ingenious men of the gai saber to whom Europe owes so much and   almost owes itself     261 Vanity is one of the thing which are perhaps most difficult for   a noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where another   kind of man think he see it selfevidently The problem for him is   to represent to his mind being who seek to arouse a good opinion of   themselves which they themselves do not possessand consequently also   do not deserveand who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion   afterwards This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so   selfdisrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable   that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful   about it in most case when it is spoken of He will say for   instance I may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand   may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others   precisely a I rate itthat however is not vanity but selfconceit   or in most case that which is called humility and also   modesty Or he will even say For many reason I can delight in   the good opinion of others perhaps because I love and honour them   and rejoice in all their joy perhaps also because their good opinion   endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps   because the good opinion of others even in case where I do not share   it is useful to me or give promise of usefulnessall this however   is not vanity The man of noble character must first bring it home   forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from   time immemorial in all social stratum in any way dependent the ordinary   man WAS only that which he PASSED FORnot being at all accustomed to   fix value he did not assign even to himself any other value than that   which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to   create value It may be looked upon a the result of an extraordinary   atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always WAITING   for an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself   to it yet by no mean only to a good opinion but also to a bad   and unjust one think for instance of the greater part of the   selfappreciations and selfdepreciations which believing woman learn   from their confessor and which in general the believing Christian   learns from his Church In fact conformably to the slow rise of the   democratic social order and it cause the blending of the blood   of master and slave the originally noble and rare impulse of   the master to assign a value to themselves and to think well of   themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but   it ha at all time an older ampler and more radically ingrained   propensity opposed to itand in the phenomenon of vanity this older   propensity overmasters the younger The vain person rejoices over EVERY   good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point   of view of it usefulness and equally regardless of it truth or   falsehood just a he suffers from every bad opinion for he subject   himself to both he feel himself subjected to both by that oldest   instinct of subjection which break forth in himIt is the slave   in the vain man blood the remains of the slave craftinessand how   much of the slave is still left in woman for instancewhich   seek to SEDUCE to good opinion of itself it is the slave too who   immediately afterwards fall prostrate himself before these opinion a   though he had not called them forthAnd to repeat it again vanity is   an atavism     262 A SPECIES originates and a type becomes established and strong in   the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE condition On   the other hand it is known by the experience of breeder that specie   which receive superabundant nourishment and in general a surplus of   protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop   variation and are fertile in prodigy and monstrosity also in   monstrous vice Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say   an ancient Greek polis or Venice a a voluntary or involuntary   contrivance for the purpose of REARING human being there are there men   beside one another thrown upon their own resource who want to make   their specie prevail chiefly because they MUST prevail or else   run the terrible danger of being exterminated The favour the   superabundance the protection are there lacking under which variation   are fostered the specie need itself a specie a something which   precisely by virtue of it hardness it uniformity and simplicity of   structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in   constant struggle with it neighbour or with rebellious or   rebellionthreatening vassal The most varied experience teach it   what are the quality to which it principally owes the fact that   it still exists in spite of all Gods and men and ha hitherto been   victorious these quality it call virtue and these virtue alone   it develops to maturity It doe so with severity indeed it desire   severity every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education   of youth in the control of woman in the marriage custom in the   relation of old and young in the penal law which have an eye only   for the degenerating it count intolerance itself among the virtue   under the name of justice A type with few but very marked feature   a specie of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent   men and a such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and   nuance of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitude   of generation the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE   condition is a already remarked the cause of a type becoming   stable and hard Finally however a happy state of thing result the   enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps no more enemy among the   neighbouring people and the mean of life even of the enjoyment   of life are present in superabundance With one stroke the bond and   constraint of the old discipline severs it is no longer regarded a   necessary a a condition of existenceif it would continue it can   only do so a a form of LUXURY a an archaizing TASTE Variations   whether they be deviation into the higher finer and rarer or   deterioration and monstrosity appear suddenly on the scene in the   greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dare to be individual   and detach himself At this turningpoint of history there manifest   themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a   magnificent manifold virginforestlike upgrowth and upstriving a   kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary   decay and selfdestruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly   exploding egoism which strive with one another for sun and light   and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for   themselves by mean of the hitherto existing morality It wa this   morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bent   the bow in so threatening a mannerit is now out of date it is   getting out of date The dangerous and disquieting point ha been   reached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life IS   LIVED BEYOND the old morality the individual stand out and is   obliged to have recourse to his own lawgiving his own art and   artifice for selfpreservation selfelevation and selfdeliverance   Nothing but new Why s nothing but new How s no common formula any   longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay   deterioration and the loftiest desire frightfully entangled the   genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopia of good and bad   a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn full of new charm   and mystery peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied   corruption Danger is again present the mother of morality great   danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and   friend into the street into their own child into their own heart   into all the most personal and secret recess of their desire and   volition What will the moral philosopher who appear at this time have   to preach They discover these sharp onlooker and loafer that the   end is quickly approaching that everything around them decay and   produce decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow   except one specie of man the incurably MEDIOCRE The mediocre alone   have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselvesthey will   be the men of the future the sole survivor be like them become   mediocre is now the only morality which ha still a significance   which still obtains a hearingBut it is difficult to preach this   morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it   desire it ha to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly   loveit will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY     263 There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK which more than anything else is   already the sign of a HIGH rank there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES   of reverence which lead one to infer noble origin and habit The   refinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test   when something pass by that is of the highest rank but is not   yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touch and   incivility something that go it way like a living touchstone   undistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiled   and disguised He whose task and practice it is to investigate soul   will avail himself of many variety of this very art to determine the   ultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to which   it belongs he will test it by it INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE DIFFERENCE   ENGENDRE HAINE the vulgarity of many a nature spurt up suddenly like   dirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrine any   book bearing the mark of great destiny is brought before it while   on the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of the   eye a cessation of all gesture by which it is indicated that a soul   FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect The way in which on   the whole the reverence for the BIBLE ha hitherto been maintained   in Europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of   manner which Europe owes to Christianity book of such profoundness   and supreme significance require for their protection an external   tyranny of authority in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousand of   year which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them Much ha been   achieved when the sentiment ha been at last instilled into the mass   the shallowpates and the booby of every kind that they are not   allowed to touch everything that there are holy experience before   which they must take off their shoe and keep away the unclean handit   is almost their highest advance towards humanity On the contrary in   the socalled cultured class the believer in modern idea nothing   is perhaps so repulsive a their lack of shame the easy insolence of   eye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything and it   is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste and   more tact for reverence among the people among the lower class of   the people especially among peasant than among the newspaperreading   DEMIMONDE of intellect the cultured class     264 It can not be effaced from a man soul what his ancestor have   preferably and most constantly done whether they were perhaps diligent   economizer attached to a desk and a cashbox modest and citizenlike   in their desire modest also in their virtue or whether they were   accustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasure   and probably of still ruder duty and responsibility or whether   finally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privilege of   birth and possession in order to live wholly for their faithfor their   Godas men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blush   at every compromise It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have   the quality and predilection of his parent and ancestor in his   constitution whatever appearance may suggest to the contrary This is   the problem of race Granted that one know something of the parent   it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child any kind   of offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsy   selfvauntingthe three thing which together have constituted the   genuine plebeian type in all timessuch must pas over to the child a   surely a bad blood and with the help of the best education and culture   one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredityAnd   what else doe education and culture try to do nowadays In our very   democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture MUST   be essentially the art of deceivingdeceiving with regard to origin   with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul An educator   who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called out   constantly to his pupil Be true Be natural Show yourselves a you   areeven such a virtuous and

of displeasing innocent ear I submit that egoism   belongs to the essence of a noble soul I mean the unalterable belief   that to a being such a we other being must naturally be in   subjection and have to sacrifice themselves The noble soul accepts the   fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of   harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather a something   that may have it basis in the primary law of thingsif he sought a   designation for it he would say It is justice itself He acknowledges   under certain circumstance which made him hesitate at first that   there are other equally privileged one a soon a he ha settled this   question of rank he move among those equal and equally privileged   one with the same assurance a regard modesty and delicate respect   which he enjoys in intercourse with himselfin accordance with an   innate heavenly mechanism which all the star understand It is an   ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism this artfulness and selflimitation   in intercourse with his equalsevery star is a similar egoist he   honour HIMSELF in them and in the right which he concedes to them he   ha no doubt that the exchange of honour and right a the ESSENCE of   all intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of thing The   noble soul give a he take prompted by the passionate and sensitive   instinct of requital which is at the root of his nature The notion of   favour ha INTER PARES neither significance nor good repute there   may be a sublime way of letting gift a it were light upon one from   above and of drinking them thirstily like dewdrop but for those   art and display the noble soul ha no aptitude His egoism hinders him   here in general he look aloft unwillinglyhe look either FORWARD   horizontally and deliberately or downwardsHE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A   HEIGHT     266 One can only truly esteem him who doe not LOOK OUT FOR   himselfGoethe to Rath Schlosser     267 The Chinese have a proverb which mother even teach their child   SIAOSIN MAKE THY HEART SMALL This is the essentially fundamental   tendency in latterday civilization I have no doubt that an ancient   Greek also would first of all remark the selfdwarfing in u Europeans   of todayin this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful   to him     268 What after all is ignoblenessWords are vocal symbol for   idea idea however are more or le definite mental symbol   for frequently returning and concurring sensation for group of   sensation It is not sufficient to use the same word in order to   understand one another we must also employ the same word for the same   kind of internal experience we must in the end have experience IN   COMMON On this account the people of one nation understand one another

comprehension people always   unite closer and closer The greater the danger the greater is the   need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to   misunderstand one another in dangerthat is what can not at all be   dispensed with in intercourse Also in all love and friendship one ha   the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery   ha been made that in using the same word one of the two party ha   feeling thought intuition wish or fear different from those of   the other The fear of the eternal misunderstanding that is the good   genius which so often keep person of different sex from too   hasty attachment to which sense and heart prompt themand NOT some   Schopenhauerian genius of the specie Whichever group of sensation   within a soul

more a psychologista born an unavoidable psychologist   and souldivinerturns his attention to the more select case and   individual the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy   he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man For   the corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusually   constituted soul is in fact the rule it is dreadful to have such a   rule always before one eye The manifold torment of the psychologist   who ha discovered this ruination who discovers once and then   discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history this universal   inner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late in every   sensemay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with   bitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt at   selfdestructionof his going to ruin himself One may perceive   in almost every psychologist a telltale inclination for delightful   intercourse with commonplace and wellordered men the fact is thereby   disclosed that he always requires healing that he need a sort   of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight and   incisivenessfrom what his businesshas laid upon his conscience   The fear of his memory is peculiar to him He is easily silenced by the   judgment of others he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour   admire love and glorify where he ha PERCEIVEDor he even conceals   his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion Perhaps   the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that precisely   where he ha learnt GREAT SYMPATHY together with great CONTEMPT the   multitude the educated and the visionary have on their part learnt   great reverencereverence for great men and marvelous animal for   the sake of whom one blesses and honour the fatherland the earth the   dignity of mankind and one own self to whom one point the young   and in view of whom one educates them And who know but in all great   instance hitherto just the same

  forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost in   the mud and almost in love with it until they become like the   WillotheWisps around the swamp and PRETEND TO BE starsthe people   then call them idealistsoften struggling with protracted disgust   with an everreappearing phantom of disbelief which make them cold   and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour faith a it is   out of the hand of intoxicated adulatorswhat a TORMENT these great   artist are and the socalled higher men in general to him who ha once   found them out It is thus conceivable that it is just from womanwho   is clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eager   to help and save to an extent far beyond her powersthat THEY have   learnt so readily those outbreak of boundless devoted SYMPATHY which   the multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understand   and overwhelm with prying and selfgratifying interpretation This   sympathizing invariably deceives itself a to it power woman would   like to believe that love can do EVERYTHINGit is the SUPERSTITION   peculiar to her Alas he who know the heart find out how poor   helpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest love   ishe find that it rather DESTROYS than savesIt is possible that   under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden   one of the most painful case of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE   the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart that   never had enough of any human love that DEMANDED love that demanded   inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terrible   outburst against those who refused him their love the story of a poor   soul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to send   thither those who WOULD NOT love himand that at last enlightened   about human love had to invent a God who is entire love entire   CAPACITY for lovewho take pity on human love because it is so   paltry so ignorant He who ha such sentiment he who ha such   KNOWLEDGE about loveSEEKS for deathBut why should one deal with   such painful matter Provided of course that one is not obliged to do   so     270 The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who ha   suffered deeplyit almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men   can sufferthe chilling certainty with which he is thoroughly imbued   and coloured that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than the   shrewdest and wisest can ever know that he ha been familiar with   and at home in many distant dreadful world of which YOU know   nothingthis silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer this   pride of the elect of knowledge of the initiated of the almost   sacrificed find all form of disguise necessary to protect itself from   contact with officious and sympathizing hand and in general from all   that is not it equal in suffering Profound suffering make noble   it separatesOne of the most refined form of disguise is Epicurism   along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which take   suffering lightly and put itself on the defensive against all that   is sorrowful and profound They are gay men who make use of gaiety   because they are misunderstood on account of itthey WISH to be   misunderstood There are scientific mind who make use of science   because it give a gay appearance and because scientificness lead to   the conclusion that a person is superficialthey WISH to mislead to a   false conclusion There are free insolent mind which would fain conceal   and deny that they are broken proud incurable heart the cynicism of   Hamletthe case of Galiani and occasionally folly itself is the mask   of an unfortunate OVERASSURED knowledgeFrom which it follows that it   is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask   and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place     271 That which separate two men most profoundly is a different sense   and grade of purity What doe it matter about all their honesty and   reciprocal usefulness what doe it matter about all their mutual   goodwill the fact still remainsthey can not smell each other The   highest instinct for purity place him who is affected with it in the   most extraordinary and dangerous isolation a a saint for it is just   holinessthe highest spiritualization of the instinct in question Any   kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath   any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out   of night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction into   clearness brightness depth and refinementjust a much a such a   tendency DISTINGUISHESit is a noble tendencyit also SEPARATESThe   pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human alltoohuman   And there are grade and height where pity itself is regarded by him a   impurity a filth     272 Signs of nobility never to think of lowering our duty to the   rank of duty for everybody to be unwilling to renounce or to share   our responsibility to count our prerogative and the exercise of   them among our DUTIES     273 A man who strives after great thing look upon every one whom   he encounter on his way either a a mean of advance or a delay and   hindranceor a a temporary restingplace His peculiar lofty BOUNTY   to his fellowmen is only possible when he attains his elevation and   dominates Impatience and the consciousness of being always condemned   to comedy up to that timefor even strife is a comedy and conceals the   end a every mean doesspoil all intercourse for him this kind of   man is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it     274 THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAITHappy chance are necessary and   many incalculable element in order that a higher man in whom the   solution of a problem is dormant may yet take action or break forth   a one might sayat the right moment On an average it DOES NOT happen   and in all corner of the earth there are waiting one sitting who   hardly know to what extent they are waiting and still le that they   wait in vain Occasionally too the waking call come too latethe   chance which give permission to take actionwhen their best youth   and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many   a one just a he sprang up ha found with horror that his limb are   benumbed and his spirit are now too heavy It is too late he ha   said to himselfand ha become selfdistrustful and henceforth for ever   uselessIn the domain of genius may not the Raphael without   hand taking the expression in it widest sense perhaps not be the   exception but the rulePerhaps genius is by no mean so rare but   rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize   over the GREEK INSERTED HERE the right timein order to take   chance by the forelock     275 He who doe not WISH to see the height of a man look all the   more sharply at what is low in him and in the foregroundand thereby   betrays himself     276 In all kind of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is   better off than the nobler soul the danger of the latter must be   greater the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in   fact immense considering the multiplicity of the condition of it   existenceIn a lizard a finger grows again which ha been lost not so   in man     277 It is too bad Always the old story When a man ha finished   building his house he find that he ha learnt unawares something   which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before hebegan to build The   eternal fatal Too late The melancholia of everything COMPLETED     278Wanderer who art thou I see thee follow thy path without scorn   without love with unfathomable eye wet and sad a a

Only name it whatever I have   I offer thee To refresh me To refresh me Oh thou prying one   what sayest thou But give me I pray thee What what Speak out   Another mask A second mask     279 Men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy they   have a mode of seizing upon happiness a though they would choke and   strangle it out of jealousyah they know only too well that it will   flee from them     280 Bad Bad What Does he notgo back Yes But you misunderstand   him when you complain about it He go back like every one who is about   to make a great spring     281Will people believe it of me But I insist that they believe it   of me I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about   myself only in very rare case only compulsorily always without   delight in the subject ready to digress from myself and always   without faith in the result owing to an unconquerable distrust of the   POSSIBILITY of selfknowledge which ha led me so far a to feel a   CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of direct knowledge which   theorist allow themselvesthis matter of fact is almost the most   certain thing I know about myself There must be a sort of repugnance   in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myselfIs there perhaps   some enigma therein Probably but fortunately nothing for my own   teethPerhaps it betrays the specie to which I belongbut not to   myself a is sufficiently agreeable to me     282But what ha happened to youI do not know he said   hesitatingly perhaps the Harpies have flown over my tableIt   sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle sober retiring man becomes   suddenly mad break the plate upset the table shriek raf   and shock everybodyand finally withdraws ashamed and raging at   himselfwhither for what purpose To famish apart To suffocate with   his memoriesTo him who ha the desire of a lofty and dainty soul   and only seldom find his table laid and his food prepared the danger   will always be greatnowadays however it is extraordinarily so   Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age with which he doe   not like to eat out of the same dish he may readily perish of hunger   and thirstor should he nevertheless finally fall to of sudden   nauseaWe have probably all sat at table to which we did not belong   and precisely the most spiritual of u who are most difficult to   nourish know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden   insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmatesthe   AFTERDINNER NAUSEA     283 If one wish to praise at all it is a delicate and at the   same time a noble selfcontrol to praise only where one DOES NOT   agreeotherwise in fact one would praise oneself which is contrary   to good tastea selfcontrol to be sure which offer excellent   opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING To be able to   allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one must   not live among intellectual imbecile but rather among men whose   misunderstanding and mistake amuse by their refinementor one will   have to pay dearly for itHe praise me THEREFORE he acknowledges me   to be rightthis asinine method of inference spoil half of the life   of u recluse for it brings the ass into our neighbourhood and   friendship     284 To live in a vast and proud tranquility always beyond To have   or not to have one emotion one For and

Goethes   Faust Part II Act V The word of Dr MarianusBut there is a   reverse kind of man who is also upon a height and ha also a free   prospectbut look DOWNWARDS     287 What is noble What doe the word noble still mean for u   nowadays How doe the noble man betray himself how is he recognized   under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by which   everything is rendered opaque and leadenIt is not his action which   establish his claimactions are always ambiguous always inscrutable   neither is it his work One find nowadays among artist and scholar   plenty of those who betray by their work that a profound longing for   nobleness impels them but this very NEED of nobleness is radically   different from the need of the noble soul itself and is in fact the   eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof It is not the work   but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of   rankto employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper   meaningit is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul ha about   itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and   perhaps also is not to be lostTHE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR   ITSELF     288 There are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn   and twist themselves a they will and hold their hand before their   treacherous eyesas though the hand were not a betrayer it always   come out at last that they have something which they hidenamely   intellect One of the subtlest mean of deceiving at least a long a   possible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider   than one really iswhich in everyday life is often a desirable a   an umbrellais called ENTHUSIASM including what belongs to it for   instance virtue For a Galiani said who wa obliged to know it VERTU   EST ENTHOUSIASME     289 In the writing of a recluse one always hears something of the echo   of the wilderness something of the murmuring tone and timid vigilance   of solitude in his strongest word even in his cry itself there   sound a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment He who   ha sat day and night from year end to year end alone with his   soul in familiar discord and discourse he who ha become a cavebear   or a treasureseeker or a treasureguardian and dragon in his caveit   may be a labyrinth but can also be a goldminehis idea themselves   eventually acquire a twilightcolour of their own and an odour a much   of the depth a of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive   which blow chilly upon every passerby The recluse doe not believe   that a philosophersupposing that a philosopher ha always in the first   place been a recluseever expressed his actual and ultimate opinion in   book are not book written precisely to hide what is in usindeed   he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have ultimate and actual   opinion at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must   necessarily be a still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer   world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every   foundation Every philosophy is a foreground philosophythis is a   recluse verdict There is something arbitrary in the fact that the   PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around   that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeperthere   is also something suspicious in it Every philosophy also CONCEALS a   philosophy every opinion is also a LURKINGPLACE every word is also a   MASK     290 Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being   misunderstood The latter perhaps wound his vanity but the former   wound his heart his sympathy which always say Ah why would you   also have a hard a time of it a I have     291 Man a COMPLEX mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny   to the other animal by his artifice and sagacity rather than by his   strength ha invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his   soul a something SIMPLE and the whole of morality is a long audacious   falsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of   the soul becomes possible From this point of view there is perhaps much   more in the conception of art than is generally believed     292 A philosopher that is a man who constantly experience see   hears suspect hope and dream extraordinary thing who is struck   by his own thought a if they came from the outside from above and   below a a specie of event and lightningflashes PECULIAR TO HIM who   is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightning a portentous   man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and   something uncanny going on A philosopher ala a being who often   run away from himself is often afraid of himselfbut whose curiosity   always make him come to himself again     293 A man who say I like that I take it for my own and mean to   guard and protect it from every one a man who can conduct a case   carry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a woman   punish and overthrow insolence a man who ha his indignation and his   sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the   animal willingly submit and naturally belong in short a man who is a   MASTER by naturewhen such a man ha sympathy well THAT sympathy ha   value But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer Or of   those even who preach sympathy There is nowadays throughout almost the   whole of Europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain   and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing   which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seek   to deck itself out a something superiorthere is a regular cult of   suffering The UNMANLINESS of that which is called sympathy by such   group of visionary is always I believe the first thing that   strike the eyeOne must resolutely and radically taboo this latest   form of bad taste and finally I wish people to put the good amulet   GAI SABER gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck a   a protection against it     294 THE OLYMPIAN VICEDespite the philosopher who a a genuine   Englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking   mindsLaughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which every   thinking mind will strive to overcome HobbesI would even   allow myself to rank philosopher according to the quality of their   laughingup to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter And supposing   that Gods also philosophize which I am strongly inclined to believe   owing to many reasonsI have no doubt that they also know how to laugh   thereby in an overmanlike and new fashionand at the expense of all   serious thing Gods are fond of ridicule it seems that they can not   refrain from laughter even in holy matter     295 The genius of the heart a that great mysterious one posse   it the temptergod and born ratcatcher of conscience whose voice can   descend into the netherworld of every soul who neither speaks a word   nor cast a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch   of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he know how to   appearnot a he is but in a guise which act a an ADDITIONAL   constraint on his follower to press ever closer to him to follow him   more cordially and thoroughlythe genius of the heart which imposes   silence and attention on everything loud and selfconceited which   smoothes rough soul and make them taste a new longingto lie placid   a a mirror that the deep heaven may be reflected in themthe genius   of the heart which teach the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate   and to grasp more delicately which scent the hidden and forgotten   treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark   ice and is a diviningrod for every grain of gold long buried and   imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with   which every one go away richer not favoured or surprised not a   though gratified and oppressed by the good thing of others but richer   in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a   thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more   bruised but full of hope which a yet lack name full of a new will   and current full of a new illwill and countercurrent but what am I   doing my friend Of whom am I talking to you Have I forgotten myself   so far that I have not even told you his name Unless it be that you   have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God   and spirit is that wish to be PRAISED in such a manner For a it   happens to every one who from childhood onward ha always been on his   leg and in foreign land I have also encountered on my path many   strange and dangerous spirit above all however and again and again   the one of whom I have just spoken in fact no le a personage than   the God DIONYSUS the great equivocator and tempter to whom a you   know I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my firstfruitsthe   last a it seems to me who ha offered a SACRIFICE to him for I   have found no one who could understand what I wa then doing In   the meantime however I have learned much far too much about the   philosophy of this God and a I said from mouth to mouthI the last   disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus and perhaps I might at last   begin to give you my friend a far a I am allowed a little taste of   this philosophy In a hushed voice a is but seemly for it ha to do   with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny The   very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore Gods also   philosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and might   perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophersamong you my   friend there is le to be said against it except that it come too   late and not at the right time for a it ha been disclosed to me you   are loth nowadays to believe in God and god It may happen too that   in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the   strict usage of your ear Certainly the God in question went further   very much further in such dialogue and wa always many pace ahead of   me Indeed if it were allowed I should have to give him according   to human usage fine ceremonious tide of lustre and merit I should   have to extol his courage a investigator and discoverer his fearless   honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom But such a God doe not know   what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp Keep that he   would say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else require   it Ihave no reason to cover my nakedness One suspect that this   kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lack shameHe once said   Under certain circumstance I love mankindand referred thereby to   Ariadne who wa present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave   inventive animal that ha not his equal upon earth he make his way   even through all labyrinth I like man and often think how I can   still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more   profoundStronger more evil and more profound I asked in horror   Yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more   beautifuland thereby the temptergod smiled with his halcyon smile   a though he had just paid some charming compliment One here see at   once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacksand in general   there are good ground for supposing that in some thing the Gods could   all of them come to u men for instruction We men aremore human     296 Alas what are you after all my written and painted thought Not   long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorn   and secret spice that you made me sneeze and laughand now You   have already doffed your novelty and some of you I fear are ready   to become truth so immortal do they look so pathetically honest so   tedious And wa it ever otherwise What then do we write and paint   we mandarin with Chinese brush we immortalisers of thing which LEND   themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting Alas only   that which is just about to fade and begin to lose it odour Alas   only exhausted and departing storm and belated yellow sentiment Alas   only bird strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves be   captured with the handwith OUR hand We immortalize what can not live   and fly much longer thing only which are exhausted and mellow And it   is only for your AFTERNOON you my written and painted thought for   which

of Hippo     Translated by E B Pusey Edward Bouverie       AD 401           BOOK I       Great art Thou O Lord and greatly to be praised great is Thy power   and Thy wisdom infinite And Thee would man praise man but a particle   of Thy creation man that bear about him his mortality the witness of   his sin the witness that Thou resistest the proud yet would man praise   Thee he but a particle of Thy creation Thou awakest u to delight in   Thy praise for Thou madest u for Thyself and our heart is restless   until it repose in Thee Grant me Lord to know and understand which is   first to call on Thee or to praise Thee and again to know Thee or   to call on Thee for who can call on Thee not knowing Thee for he that   knoweth Thee not may call on Thee a other than Thou art Or is it   rather that we call on Thee that we may know Thee but how shall they   call on Him in whom they have not believed or how shall they believe   without a preacher and they that seek the Lord shall praise Him for   they that seek shall find Him and they that find shall praise Him   I will seek Thee Lord by calling on Thee and will call on Thee   believing in Thee for to u hast Thou been preached My faith Lord   shall call on Thee which Thou hast given me wherewith Thou hast   inspired me through the Incarnation of Thy Son through the ministry of   the Preacher     And how shall I call upon my God my God and Lord since when I call   for Him I shall be calling Him to myself and what room is there within   me whither my God can come into me whither can God come into me God   who made heaven and earth is there indeed O Lord my God aught in me   that can contain Thee do then heaven and earth which Thou hast made   and wherein Thou hast made me contain Thee or because nothing which   exists could exist without Thee doth therefore whatever exists contain   Thee Since then I too exist why do I seek that Thou shouldest enter   into me who were not wert Thou not in me Why because I am not gone   down in hell and yet Thou art there also For if I go down into hell   Thou art there I could not be then O my God could not be at all   wert Thou not in me or rather unless I were in Thee of whom are all   thing by whom are all thing in whom are all thing Even so Lord   even so Whither do I call Thee since I am in Thee or whence canst   Thou enter into me for whither can I go beyond heaven and earth that   thence my God should come into me who hath said I fill the heaven and   the earth     Do the heaven and earth then contain Thee since Thou fillest them or   dost Thou fill them and yet overflow since they do not contain Thee   And whither when the heaven and the earth are filled pourest Thou   forth the remainder of Thyself or hast Thou no need that aught contain   Thee who containest all thing since what Thou fillest Thou fillest   by containing it for the vessel which Thou fillest uphold Thee not   since though they were broken Thou wert not poured out And when Thou   art poured out on u Thou art not cast down but Thou upliftest u   Thou art not dissipated but Thou gatherest u But Thou who fillest   all thing fillest Thou them with Thy whole self or since all thing   can not contain Thee wholly do they contain part of Thee and all at   once the same part or each it own part the greater more the smaller   le And is then one part of Thee greater another le or art Thou   wholly every where while nothing contains Thee wholly     What art Thou then my God what but the Lord God For who is Lord   but the Lord or who is God save our God Most highest most good most   potent most omnipotent most merciful yet most just most hidden   yet most present most beautiful yet most strong stable yet   incomprehensible unchangeable yet allchanging never new never old   allrenewing and bringing age upon the proud and they know it not   ever working ever at rest still gathering yet nothing lacking   supporting filling and overspreading creating nourishing and   maturing seeking yet having all thing Thou lovest without passion   art jealous without anxiety repentest yet grievest not art angry   yet serene changest Thy work Thy purpose unchanged receivest again   what Thou findest yet didst never lose never in need yet rejoicing   in gain never covetous yet exacting usury Thou receivest over and   above that Thou mayest owe and who hath aught that is not Thine Thou   payest debt owing nothing remittest debt losing nothing And what   had I now said my God my life my holy joy or what saith any man when   he speaks of Thee Yet woe to him that speaketh not since mute are even   the most eloquent     Oh that I might repose on Thee Oh that Thou wouldest enter into my   heart and inebriate it that I may forget my ill and embrace Thee   my sole good What art Thou to me In Thy pity teach me to utter it   Or what am I to Thee that Thou demandest my love and if I give it not   art wroth with me and threatenest me with grievous woe Is it then a   slight woe to love Thee not Oh for Thy mercy sake tell me O Lord   my God what Thou art unto me Say unto my soul I am thy salvation So   speak that I may hear Behold Lord my heart is before Thee open Thou   the ear thereof and say unto my soul I am thy salvation After this   voice let me haste and take hold on Thee Hide not Thy face from me   Let me dielest I dieonly let me see Thy face     Narrow is the mansion of my soul enlarge Thou it that Thou mayest   enter in It is ruinous repair Thou it It ha that within which must   offend Thine eye I confess and know it But who shall cleanse it or   to whom should I cry save Thee Lord cleanse me from my secret fault   and spare Thy servant from the power of the enemy I believe and   therefore do I speak Lord Thou knowest Have I not confessed against   myself my transgression unto Thee and Thou my God hast forgiven the   iniquity of my heart I contend not in judgment with Thee who art the   truth I fear to deceive myself lest mine iniquity lie unto itself   Therefore I contend not in judgment with Thee for if Thou Lord   shouldest mark iniquity O Lord who shall abide it     Yet suffer me to speak unto Thy mercy me dust and ash Yet suffer me   to speak since I speak to Thy mercy and not to scornful man Thou too   perhaps despisest me yet wilt Thou return and have compassion upon me   For what would I say O Lord my God but that I know not whence I   came into this dying life shall I call it or living death Then   immediately did the comfort of Thy compassion take me up a I heard   for I remember it not from the parent of my flesh out of whose   substance Thou didst sometime fashion me Thus there received me the   comfort of woman milk For neither my mother nor my nurse stored   their own breast for me but Thou didst bestow the food of my infancy   through them according to Thine ordinance whereby Thou distributest   Thy rich through the hidden spring of all thing Thou also gavest me   to desire no more than Thou gavest and to my nurse willingly to give   me what Thou gavest them For they with a heaventaught affection   willingly gave me what they abounded with from Thee For this my good   from them wa good for them Nor indeed from them wa it but through   them for from Thee O God are all good thing and from my God is all   my health This I since learned Thou through these Thy gift within   me and without proclaiming Thyself unto me For then I knew but to   suck to repose in what pleased and cry at what offended my flesh   nothing more     Afterwards I began to smile first in sleep then waking for so it   wa told me of myself and I believed it for we see the like in other   infant though of myself I remember it not Thus little by little I   became conscious where I wa and to have a wish to express my wish   to those who could content them and I could not for the wish were   within me and they without nor could they by any sense of theirs enter   within my spirit So I flung about at random limb and voice making   the few sign I could and such a I could like though in truth very   little like what I wished And when I wa not presently obeyed my   wish being hurtful or unintelligible then I wa indignant with my   elder for not submitting to me with those owing me no service for   not serving me and avenged myself on them by tear Such have I learnt   infant to be from observing them and that I wa myself such they all   unconscious have shown me better than my nurse who knew it     And lo my infancy died long since and I live But Thou Lord who for   ever livest and in whom nothing dy for before the foundation of the   world and before all that can be called before Thou art and art   God and Lord of all which Thou hast created in Thee abide fixed   for ever the first cause of all thing unabiding and of all thing   changeable the spring abide in Thee unchangeable and in Thee live the   eternal reason of all thing unreasoning and temporal Say Lord to   me Thy suppliant say allpitying to me Thy pitiable one say did   my infancy succeed another age of mine that died before it wa it   that which I spent within my mother womb for of that I have heard   somewhat and have myself seen woman with child and what before that   life again O God my joy wa I any where or any body For this have I   none to tell me neither father nor mother nor experience of others   nor mine own memory Dost Thou mock me for asking this and bid me   praise Thee and acknowledge Thee for that I do know     I acknowledge Thee Lord of heaven and earth and praise Thee for my   first rudiment of being and my infancy whereof I remember nothing   for Thou hast appointed that man should from others guess much a to   himself and believe much on the strength of weak female Even then I   had being and life and at my infancy close I could seek for sign   whereby to make known to others my sensation Whence could such a being   be save from Thee Lord Shall any be his own artificer or can there   elsewhere be derived any vein which may stream essence and life into   u save from thee O Lord in whom essence and life are one for Thou   Thyself art supremely Essence and Life For Thou art most high and art   not changed neither in Thee doth today come to a close yet in Thee   doth it come to a close because all such thing also are in Thee For   they had no way to pas away unless Thou upheldest them And since   Thy year fail not Thy year are one today How many of ours and   our father year have flowed away through Thy today and from it   received the measure and the mould of such being a they had and still   others shall flow away and so receive the mould of their degree of   being But Thou art still the same and all thing of tomorrow and all   beyond and all of yesterday and all behind it Thou hast done today   What is it to me though any comprehend not this Let him also rejoice   and say What thing is this Let him rejoice even thus and be content   rather by not discovering to discover Thee than by discovering not to   discover Thee     Hear O God Alas for man sin So saith man and Thou pitiest him   for Thou madest him but sin in him Thou madest not Who remindeth me of   the sin of my infancy for in Thy sight none is pure from sin not even   the infant whose life is but a day upon the earth Who remindeth me   doth not each little infant in whom I see what of myself I remember   not What then wa my sin wa it that I hung upon the breast and cried   for should I now so do for food suitable to my age justly should I be   laughed at and reproved What I then did wa worthy reproof but since   I could not understand reproof custom and reason forbade me to be   reproved For those habit when grown we root out and cast away Now   no man though he prune wittingly cast away what is good Or wa   it then good even for a while to cry for what if given would hurt   bitterly to resent that person free and it own elder yea the very   author of it birth served it not that many besides wiser than it   obeyed not the nod of it good pleasure to do it best to strike and   hurt because command were not obeyed which had been obeyed to it   hurt The weakness then of infant limb not it will is it innocence   Myself have seen and known even a baby envious it could not speak yet   it turned pale and looked bitterly on it fosterbrother Who know not   this Mothers and nurse tell you that they allay these thing by I know   not what remedy Is that too innocence when the fountain of milk   is flowing in rich abundance not to endure one to share it though   in extremest need and whose very life a yet depends thereon We bear   gently with all this not a being no or slight evil but because they   will disappear a year increase for though tolerated now the very   same temper are utterly intolerable when found in riper year     Thou then O Lord my God who gavest life to this my infancy   furnishing thus with sens a we see the frame Thou gavest   compacting it limb ornamenting it proportion and for it general   good and safety implanting in it all vital function Thou commandest   me to praise Thee in these thing to confess unto Thee and sing unto   Thy name Thou most Highest For Thou art God Almighty and Good even   hadst Thou done nought but only this which none could do but Thou   whose Unity is the mould of all thing who out of Thy own fairness   makest all thing fair and orderest all thing by Thy law This age   then Lord whereof I have no remembrance which I take on others word   and guess from other infant that I have passed true though the guess   be I am yet loth to count in this life of mine which I live in this   world For no le than that which I spent in my mother womb is it   hid from me in the shadow of forgetfulness But if I wa shapen in   iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me where I beseech Thee O   my God where Lord or when wa I Thy servant guiltless But lo that   period I pas by and what have I now to do with that of which I can   recall no vestige     Passing hence from infancy I came to boyhood or rather it came to me   displacing infancy Nor did that departfor whither went itand   yet it wa no more For I wa no longer a speechless infant but a   speaking boy This I remember and have since observed how I learned to   speak It wa not that my elder taught me word a soon after other   learning in any set method but I longing by cry and broken accent   and various motion of my limb to express my thought that so I might   have my will and yet unable to express all I willed or to whom I   willed did myself by the understanding which Thou my God gavest me   practise the sound in my memory When they named any thing and a they   spoke turned towards it I saw and remembered that they called what they   would point out by the name they uttered And that they meant this   thing and no other wa plain from the motion of their body the natural   language a it were of all nation expressed by the countenance   glance of the eye gesture of the limb and tone of the voice   indicating the affection of the mind a it pursues posse   reject or shuns And thus by constantly hearing word a they   occurred in various sentence I collected gradually for what they   stood and having broken in my mouth to these sign I thereby gave   utterance to my will Thus I exchanged with those about me these current   sign of our will and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse   of human life yet depending on parental authority and the beck of   elder     O God my God what misery and mockery did I now experience when   obedience to my teacher wa proposed to me a proper in a boy in   order that in this world I might prosper and excel in tonguescience   which should serve to the praise of men and to deceitful rich Next   I wa put to school to get learning in which I poor wretch knew not   what use there wa and yet if idle in learning I wa beaten For this   wa judged right by our forefather and many passing the same course   before u framed for u weary path through which we were fain to   pas multiplying toil and grief upon the son of Adam But Lord we   found that men called upon Thee and we learnt from them to think of   Thee according to our power a of some great One who though hidden   from our sens couldest hear and help u For so I began a a boy to   pray to Thee my aid and refuge and broke the fetter of my tongue to   call on Thee praying Thee though small yet with no small earnestness   that I might not be beaten at school And when Thou heardest me not not   thereby giving me over to folly my elder yea my very parent who   yet wished me no ill mocked my stripe my then great and grievous ill     Is there Lord any of soul so great and cleaving to Thee with so   intense affection for a sort of stupidity will in a way do it but   is there any one who from cleaving devoutly to Thee is endued with so   great a spirit that he can think a lightly of the rack and hook and   other torment against which throughout all land men call on Thee   with extreme dread mocking at those by whom they are feared most   bitterly a our parent mocked the torment which we suffered in   boyhood from our master For we feared not our torment le nor   prayed we le to Thee to escape them And yet we sinned in writing or   reading or studying le than wa exacted of u For we wanted not O   Lord memory or capacity whereof Thy will gave enough for our age but   our sole delight wa play and for this we were punished by those who   yet themselves were doing the like But elder folk idleness is called   business that of boy being really the same is punished by those   elder and none commiserates either boy or men For will any of sound   discretion approve of my being beaten a a boy because by playing a   ball I made le progress in study which I wa to learn only that   a a man I might play more unbeseemingly and what else did he who beat   me who if worsted in some trifling discussion with his fellowtutor   wa more embittered and jealous than I when beaten at ball by a   playfellow     And yet I sinned herein O Lord God the Creator and Disposer of all   thing in nature of sin the Disposer only O Lord my God I sinned in   transgressing the command of my parent and those of my master For   what they with whatever motive would have me learn I might afterwards   have put to good use For I disobeyed not from a better choice but   from love of play loving the pride of victory in my contest and to   have my ear tickled with lying fable that they might itch the more   the same curiosity flashing from my eye more and more for the show   and game of my elder Yet those who give these show are in such   esteem that almost all wish the same for their child and yet are   very willing that they should be beaten if those very game detain them   from the study whereby they would have them attain to be the giver   of them Look with pity Lord on these thing and deliver u who call   upon Thee now deliver those too who call not on Thee yet that they may   call on Thee and Thou mayest deliver them       As a boy then I had already heard of an eternal life promised   u through the humility of the Lord our God stooping to our pride and   even from the womb of my mother who greatly hoped in Thee I wa sealed   with the mark of His cross and salted with His salt Thou sawest Lord   how while yet a boy being seized on a time with sudden oppression of   the stomach and like near to deathThou sawest my God for Thou wert   my keeper with what eagerness and what faith I sought from the pious   care of my mother and Thy Church the mother of u all the baptism of   Thy Christ my God and Lord Whereupon the mother of my flesh being   much troubled since with a heart pure in Thy faith she even more   lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation would in eager haste   have provided for my consecration and cleansing by the healthgiving   sacrament confessing Thee Lord Jesus for the remission of sin   unless I had suddenly recovered And so a if I must need be   again polluted should I live my cleansing wa deferred because the   defilement of sin would after that washing bring greater and more   perilous guilt I then already believed and my mother and the whole   household except my father yet did not he prevail over the power of my   mother piety in me that a he did not yet believe so neither   should I For it wa her earnest care that Thou my God rather than he   shouldest be my father and in this Thou didst aid her to prevail over   her husband whom she the better obeyed therein also obeying Thee   who hast so commanded       I beseech Thee my God I would fain know if so Thou willest for   what purpose my baptism wa then deferred wa it for my good that the   rein wa laid loose a it were upon me for me to sin or wa it not   laid loose If not why doe it still echo in our ear on all side   Let him alone let him do a he will for he is not yet baptised but   a to bodily health no one say Let him be worse wounded for he is   not yet healed How much better then had I been at once healed and   then by my friend and my own my soul recovered health had been   kept safe in Thy keeping who gavest it Better truly But how many and   great wave of temptation seemed to hang over me after my boyhood These   my mother foresaw and preferred to expose to them the clay whence I   might afterwards be moulded than the very cast when made       In boyhood itself however so much le dreaded for me than youth   I loved not study and hated to be forced to it Yet I wa forced and   this wa well done towards me but I did not well for unless forced I   had not learnt But no one doth well against his will even though what   he doth be well Yet neither did they well who forced me but what wa   well came to me from Thee my God For they were regardless how I should   employ what they forced me to learn except to satiate the insatiate   desire of a wealthy beggary and a shameful glory But Thou by whom   the very hair of our head are numbered didst use for my good the error   of all who urged me to learn and my own who would not learn Thou   didst use for my punishmenta fit penalty for one so small a boy and   so great a sinner So by those who did not well Thou didst well for me   and by my own sin Thou didst justly punish me For Thou hast commanded   and so it is that every inordinate affection should be it own   punishment     But why did I so much hate the Greek which I studied a a boy I do not   yet fully know For the Latin I loved not what my first master but   what the socalled grammarian taught me For those first lesson   reading writing and arithmetic I thought a great a burden and penalty   a any Greek And yet whence wa this too but from the sin and vanity   of this life because I wa flesh and a breath that passeth away and   cometh not again For those first lesson were better certainly because   more certain by them I obtained and still retain the power of reading   what I find written and myself writing what I will whereas in the   others I wa forced to learn the wandering of one Aeneas forgetful of   my own and to weep for dead Dido because she killed herself for love   the while with dry eye I endured my miserable self dying among these   thing far from Thee O God my life     For what more miserable than a miserable being who commiserates not   himself weeping the death of Dido for love to Aeneas but weeping not   his own death for want of love to Thee O God Thou light of my heart   Thou bread of my inmost soul Thou Power who givest vigour to my mind   who quickenest my thought I loved Thee not I committed fornication   against Thee and all around me thus fornicating there echoed Well   done well done for the friendship of this world is fornication   against Thee and Well done well done echo on till one is ashamed   not to be thus a man And for all this I wept not I who wept for Dido   slain and seeking by the sword a stroke and wound extreme myself   seeking the while a worse extreme the extremest and lowest of Thy   creature having forsaken Thee earth passing into the earth And   if forbid to read all this I wa grieved that I might not read what   grieved me Madness like this is thought a higher and a richer learning   than that by which I learned to read and write     But now my God cry Thou aloud in my soul and let Thy truth tell me   Not so not so Far better wa that first study For lo I would   readily forget the wandering of Aeneas and all the rest rather than   how to read and write But over the entrance of the Grammar School is a   vail drawn true yet is this not so much an emblem of aught recondite   a a cloak of error Let not those whom I no longer fear cry out   against me while I confess to Thee my God whatever my soul will and   acquiesce in the condemnation of my evil way that I may love Thy   good way Let not either buyer or seller of grammarlearning cry out   against me For if I question them whether it be true that Aeneas came   on a time to Carthage a the poet tell the le learned will reply   that they know not the more learned that he never did But should I ask   with what letter the name Aeneas is written every one who ha   learnt this will answer me aright a to the sign which men have   conventionally settled If again I should ask which might be forgotten   with least detriment to the concern of life reading and writing or   these poetic fiction who doe not foresee what all must answer who   have not wholly forgotten themselves I sinned then when a a boy I   preferred those empty to those more profitable study or rather loved   the one and hated the other One and one two two and two four   this wa to me a hateful singsong the wooden horse lined with   armed men and the burning of Troy and Creusas shade and sad   similitude were the choice spectacle of my vanity     Why then did I hate the Greek classic which have the like tale For   Homer also curiously wove the like fiction and is most sweetly vain   yet wa he bitter to my boyish taste And so I suppose would Virgil   be to Grecian child when forced to learn him a I wa Homer   Difficulty in truth the difficulty of a foreign tongue dashed a it   were with gall all the sweetness of Grecian fable For not one word of   it did I understand and to make me understand I wa urged vehemently   with cruel threat and punishment Time wa also a an infant I   knew no Latin but this I learned without fear or suffering by mere   observation amid the caress of my nursery and jest of friend   smiling and sportively encouraging me This I learned without any   pressure of punishment to urge me on for my heart urged me to give   birth to it conception which I could only do by learning word not of   those who taught but of those who talked with me in whose ear also I   gave birth to the thought whatever I conceived No doubt then that   a free curiosity ha more force in our learning these thing than a   frightful enforcement Only this enforcement restrains the roving of   that freedom through Thy law O my God Thy law from the master   cane to the martyr trial being able to temper for u a wholesome   bitter recalling u to Thyself from that deadly pleasure which lure u   from Thee     Hear Lord my prayer let not my soul faint under Thy discipline nor   let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercy whereby Thou   hast drawn me out of all my most evil way that Thou mightest become a   delight to me above all the allurement which I once pursued that I may   most entirely love Thee and clasp Thy hand with all my affection and   Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation even unto the end For   lo O Lord my King and my God for Thy service be whatever useful   thing my childhood learned for Thy service that I speak write read   reckon For Thou didst grant me Thy discipline while I wa learning   vanity and my sin of delighting in those vanity Thou hast forgiven   In them indeed I learnt many a useful word but these may a well be   learned in thing not vain and that is the safe path for the step of   youth     But woe is thee thou torrent of human custom Who shall stand against   thee how long shalt thou not be dried up how long roll the son of Eve   into that huge and hideous ocean which even they scarcely overpass who   climb the cross Did not I read in thee of Jove the thunderer and the   adulterer both doubtless he could not be but so the feigned thunder   might countenance and pander to real adultery And now which of our   gowned master lends a sober ear to one who from their own school cry   out These were Homers fiction transferring thing human to the   god would he had brought down thing divine to u Yet more truly had   he said These are indeed his fiction but attributing a divine nature   to wicked men that crime might be no longer crime and whoso commits   them might seem to imitate not abandoned men but the celestial god     And yet thou hellish torrent into thee are cast the son of men with   rich reward for compassing such learning and a great solemnity is   made of it when this is going on in the forum within sight of law   appointing a salary beside the scholar payment and thou lashest   thy rock and roarest Hence word are learnt hence eloquence most   necessary to gain your end or maintain opinion As if we should have   never known such word a golden shower lap beguile temple   of the heaven or others in that passage unless Terence had brought   a lewd youth upon the stage setting up Jupiter a his example of   seduction              Viewing a picture where the tale wa drawn            Of Joves descending in a golden shower            To Danaes lap a woman to beguile     And then mark how he excites himself to lust a by celestial authority              And what God   Great Jove            Who shake heaven highest temple with his thunder              And I poor mortal man not do the same            I did it and with all my heart I did it     Not one whit more easily are the word learnt for all this vileness   but by their mean the vileness is committed with le shame Not that   I blame the word being a it were choice and precious vessel but   that wine of error which is drunk to u in them by intoxicated teacher   and if we too drink not we are beaten and have no sober judge to   whom we may appeal Yet O my God in whose presence I now without hurt   may remember this all this unhappily I learnt willingly with great   delight and for this wa pronounced a hopeful boy     Bear with me my God while I say somewhat of my wit Thy gift and on   what dotage I wasted it For a task wa set me troublesome enough to   my soul upon term of praise or shame and fear of stripe to speak   the word of Juno a she raged and mourned that she could not             This Trojan prince from Latinum turn     Which word I had heard that Juno never uttered but we were forced to   go astray in the footstep of these poetic fiction and to say in prose   much what he expressed in verse And his speaking wa most applauded in   whom the passion of rage and grief were most preeminent and clothed   in the most fitting language maintaining the dignity of the character   What is it to me O my true life my God that my declamation wa   applauded above so many of my own age and class is not all this smoke   and wind and wa there nothing else whereon to exercise my wit and   tongue Thy praise Lord Thy praise might have stayed the yet tender   shoot of my heart by the prop of Thy Scriptures so had it not trailed   away amid these empty trifle a defiled prey for the fowl of the air   For in more way than one do men sacrifice to the rebellious angel     But what marvel that I wa thus carried away to vanity and went out   from Thy presence O my God when men were set before me a model who   if in relating some action of theirs in itself not ill they committed   some barbarism or solecism being censured were abashed but when   in rich and adorned and wellordered discourse they related their own   disordered life being bepraised they gloried These thing Thou seest   Lord and holdest Thy peace longsuffering and plenteous in mercy and   truth Wilt Thou hold Thy peace for ever and even now Thou drawest out   of this horrible gulf the soul that seeketh Thee that thirsteth for   Thy pleasure whose heart saith unto Thee I have sought Thy face Thy   face Lord will I seek For darkened affection is removal from Thee   For it is not by our foot or change of place that men leave Thee or   return unto Thee Or did that Thy younger son look out for horse or   chariot or ship fly with visible wing or journey by the motion of   his limb that he might in a far country waste in riotous living all   Thou gavest at his departure a loving Father when Thou gavest and   more loving unto him when he returned empty So then in lustful that   is in darkened affection is the true distance from Thy face     Behold O Lord God yea behold patiently a Thou art wo nt how carefully   the son of men observe the covenanted rule of letter and syllable   received from those who spake before them neglecting the eternal   covenant of everlasting salvation received from Thee Insomuch that   a teacher or learner of the hereditary law of pronunciation will more   offend men by speaking without the aspirate of a uman being in   despite of the law of grammar than if he a human being hate a   human being in despite of Thine As if any enemy could be more hurtful   than the hatred with which he is incensed against him or could wound   more deeply him whom he persecutes than he wound his own soul by his   enmity Assuredly no science of letter can be so innate a the record   of conscience that he is doing to another what from another he would   be loth to suffer How deep are Thy way O God Thou only great   that sittest silent on high and by an unwearied law dispensing penal   blindness to lawless desire In quest of the fame of eloquence a man   standing before a human judge surrounded by a human throng declaiming   against his enemy with fiercest hatred will take heed most watchfully   lest by an error of the tongue he murder the word human being but   take no heed lest through the fury of his spirit he murder the real   human being     This wa the world at whose gate unhappy I lay in my boyhood this   the stage where I had feared more to commit a barbarism than having   committed one to envy those who had not These thing I speak and   confess to Thee my God for which I had praise from them whom I then   thought it all virtue to please For I saw not the abyss of vileness   wherein I wa cast away from Thine eye Before them what more foul than   I wa already displeasing even such a myself with innumerable lie   deceiving my tutor my master my parent from love of play eagerness   to see vain show and restlessness to imitate them Thefts also I   committed from my parent cellar and table enslaved by greediness or   that I might have to give to boy who sold me their play which all   the while they liked no le than I In this play too I often   sought unfair conquest conquered myself meanwhile by vain desire of   preeminence And what could I so ill endure or when I detected it   upbraided I so fiercely a that I wa doing to others and for which   if detected I wa upbraided I chose rather to quarrel than to yield   And is this the innocence of boyhood Not so Lord not so I cry Thy   mercy my God For these very sin a riper year succeed these very   sin are transferred from tutor and master from nut and ball and   sparrow to magistrate and king to gold and manor and slave just   a severer punishment displace the cane It wa the low stature then of   childhood which Thou our King didst commend a an emblem of lowliness   when Thou saidst Of such is the kingdom of heaven     Yet Lord to Thee the Creator and Governor of the universe most   excellent and most good thanks were due to Thee our God even hadst   Thou destined for me boyhood only For even then I wa I lived and   felt and had an implanted providence over my wellbeinga trace of   that mysterious Unity whence I wa derived I guarded by the inward   sense the entireness of my sens and in these minute pursuit and in   my thought on thing minute I learnt to delight in truth I hated to   be deceived had a vigorous memory wa gifted with speech wa   soothed by friendship avoided pain baseness ignorance In so small a   creature what wa not wonderful not admirable But all are gift of   my God it wa not I who gave them me and good these are and these   together are myself Good then is He that made me and He is my good   and before Him will I exult for every good which of a boy I had For it   wa my sin that not in Him but in His creaturesmyself and othersI   sought for pleasure sublimity truth and so fell headlong into   sorrow confusion error Thanks be to Thee my joy and my glory   and my confidence my God thanks be to Thee for Thy gift but do Thou   preserve them to me For so wilt Thou preserve me and those thing   shall be enlarged and perfected which Thou hast given me and I myself   shall be with Thee since even to be Thou hast given me           BOOK II       I will now call to mind my past foulness and the carnal corruption of   my soul not because I love them but that I may love Thee O my God   For love of Thy love I do it reviewing my most wicked way in the very   bitterness of my remembrance that Thou mayest grow sweet unto me Thou   sweetness never failing Thou blissful and assured sweetness and   gathering me again out of that my dissipation wherein I wa torn   piecemeal while turned from Thee the One Good I lost myself among a   multiplicity of thing For I even burnt in my youth heretofore to be   satiated in thing below and I dared to grow wild again with these   various and shadowy love my beauty consumed away and I stank in Thine   eye pleasing myself and desirous to please in the eye of men     And what wa it that I delighted in but to love and be loved but   I kept not the measure of love of mind to mind friendship bright   boundary but out of the muddy concupiscence of the flesh and the   bubblings of youth mist fumed up which beclouded and overcast my   heart that I could not discern the clear brightness of love from the   fog of lustfulness Both did confusedly boil in me and hurried my   unstayed youth over the precipice of unholy desire and sunk me in a   gulf of flagitiousnesses Thy wrath had gathered over me and I knew it   not I wa grown deaf by the clanking of the chain of my mortality the   punishment of the pride of my soul and I strayed further from Thee   and Thou lettest me alone and I wa tossed about and wasted and   dissipated and I boiled over in my fornication and Thou heldest Thy   peace O Thou my tardy joy Thou then heldest Thy peace and I wandered   further and further from Thee into more and more fruitless seedplots   of sorrow with a proud dejectedness and a restless weariness     Oh that some one had then attempered my disorder and turned to account   the fleeting beauty of these the extreme point of Thy creation had   put a bound to their pleasureableness that so the tide of my youth   might have cast themselves upon the marriage shore if they could not be   calmed and kept within the object of a family a Thy law prescribes   O Lord who this way formest the offspring of this our death being   able with a gentle hand to blunt the thorn which were excluded from Thy   paradise For Thy omnipotency is not far from u even when we be far   from Thee Else ought I more watchfully to have heeded the voice from   the cloud Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but I   spare you And it is good for a man not to touch a woman And he that   is unmarried thinketh of the thing of the Lord how he may please the   Lord but he that is married careth for the thing of this world how he   may please his wife     To these word I should have listened more attentively and being   severed for the kingdom of heaven sake had more happily awaited Thy   embrace but I poor wretch foamed like a troubled sea following the   rushing of my own tide forsaking Thee and exceeded all Thy limit yet   I escaped not Thy scourge For what mortal can For Thou wert ever with   me mercifully rigorous and besprinkling with most bitter alloy all my   unlawful pleasure that I might seek pleasure without alloy But where   to find such I could not discover save in Thee O Lord who teachest   by sorrow and woundest u to heal and killest u lest we die from   Thee Where wa I and how far wa I exiled from the delight of Thy   house in that sixteenth year of the age of my flesh when the madness   of lust to which human shamelessness giveth free licence though   unlicensed by Thy law took the rule over me and I resigned myself   wholly to it My friend meanwhile took no care by marriage to save my   fall their only care wa that I should learn to speak excellently and   be a persuasive orator     For that year were my study intermitted whilst after my return from   Madaura a neighbour city whither I had journeyed to learn grammar and   rhetoric the expense for a further journey to Carthage were being   provided for me and that rather by the resolution than the mean of my   father who wa but a poor freeman of Thagaste To whom tell I this not   to Thee my God but before Thee to mine own kind even to that small   portion of mankind a may light upon these writing of mine And to what   purpose that whosoever read this may think out of what depth we are   to cry unto Thee For what is nearer to Thine ear than a confessing   heart and a life of faith Who did not extol my father for that beyond   the ability of his mean he would furnish his son with all necessary   for a far journey for his study sake For many far abler citizen   did no such thing for their child But yet this same father had no   concern how I grew towards Thee or how chaste I were so that I were   but copious in speech however barren I were to Thy culture O God who   art the only true and good Lord of Thy field my heart     But while in that my sixteenth year I lived with my parent leaving all   school for a while a season of idleness being interposed through the   narrowness of my parent fortune the brier of unclean desire grew   rank over my head and there wa no hand to root them out When that my   father saw me at the bath now growing towards manhood and endued   with a restless youthfulness he a already hence anticipating his   descendant gladly told it to my mother rejoicing in that tumult of   the sens wherein the world forgetteth Thee it Creator and becometh   enamoured of Thy creature instead of Thyself through the fume of that   invisible wine of it selfwill turning aside and bowing down to the   very basest thing But in my mother breast Thou hadst already begun   Thy temple and the foundation of Thy holy habitation whereas my   father wa a yet but a Catechumen and that but recently She then wa   startled with a holy fear and trembling and though I wa not a yet   baptised feared for me those crooked way in which they walk who turn   their back to Thee and not their face     Woe is me and dare I say that Thou heldest Thy peace O my God while I   wandered further from Thee Didst Thou then indeed hold Thy peace to me   And whose but Thine were these word which by my mother Thy faithful   one Thou sangest in my ear Nothing whereof sunk into my heart so a   to do it For she wished and I remember in private with great anxiety   warned me not to commit fornication but especially never to defile   another man wife These seemed to me womanish advice which I should   blush to obey But they were Thine and I knew it not and I thought   Thou wert silent and that it wa she who spake by whom Thou wert not   silent unto me and in her wast despised by me her son the son of Thy   handmaid Thy servant But I knew it not and ran headlong with such   blindness that amongst my equal I wa ashamed of a le shamelessness   when I heard them boast of their flagitiousness yea and the more   boasting the more they were degraded and I took pleasure not only in   the pleasure of the deed but in the praise What is worthy of dispraise   but vice But I made myself worse than I wa that I might not be   dispraised and when in any thing I had not sinned a the abandoned   one I would say that I had done what I had not done that I might not   seem contemptible in proportion a I wa innocent or of le account   the more chaste     Behold with what companion I walked the street of Babylon and   wallowed in the mire thereof a if in a bed of spice and precious   ointment And that I might cleave the faster to it very centre the   invisible enemy trod me down and seduced me for that I wa easy to be   seduced Neither did the mother of my flesh who had now fled out of   the centre of Babylon yet went more slowly in the skirt thereof a   she advised me to chastity so heed what she had heard of me from her   husband a to restrain within the bound of conjugal affection if it   could not be pared away to the quick what she felt to be pestilent   at present and for the future dangerous She heeded not this for she   feared lest a wife should prove a clog and hindrance to my hope Not   those hope of the world to come which my mother reposed in Thee but   the hope of learning which both my parent were too desirous I should   attain my father because he had next to no thought of Thee and of   me but vain conceit my mother because she accounted that those   usual course of learning would not only be no hindrance but even some   furtherance towards attaining Thee For thus I conjecture recalling a   well a I may the disposition of my parent The rein meantime were   slackened to me beyond all temper of due severity to spend my time in   sport yea even unto dissoluteness in whatsoever I affected And in all   wa a mist intercepting from me O my God the brightness of Thy truth   and mine iniquity burst out a from very fatness     Theft is punished by Thy law O Lord and the law written in the heart   of men which iniquity itself effaces not For what thief will abide a   thief not even a rich thief one stealing through want Yet I lusted to   thieve and did it compelled by no hunger nor poverty but through a   cloyedness of welldoing and a pamperedness of iniquity For I stole   that of which I had enough and much better Nor cared I to enjoy what   I stole but joyed in the theft and sin itself A pear tree there wa   near our vineyard laden with fruit tempting neither for colour nor   taste To shake and rob this some lewd young fellow of u went late   one night having according to our pestilent custom prolonged our sport   in the street till then and took huge load not for our eating but   to fling to the very hog having only tasted them And this but to   do what we liked only because it wa misliked Behold my heart O   God behold my heart which Thou hadst pity upon in the bottom of the   bottomless pit Now behold let my heart tell Thee what it sought   there that I should be gratuitously evil having no temptation to ill   but the ill itself It wa foul and I loved it I loved to perish   I loved mine own fault not that for which I wa faulty but my fault   itself Foul soul falling from Thy firmament to utter destruction not   seeking aught through the shame but the shame itself     For there is an attractiveness in beautiful body in gold and silver   and all thing and in bodily touch sympathy hath much influence and   each other sense hath his proper object answerably tempered Worldy   honour hath also it grace and the power of overcoming and of mastery   whence spring also the thirst of revenge But yet to obtain all these   we may not depart from Thee O Lord nor decline from Thy law The life   also which here we live hath it own enchantment through a certain   proportion of it own and a correspondence with all thing beautiful   here below Human friendship also is endeared with a sweet tie by   reason of the unity formed of many soul Upon occasion of all these   and the like is sin committed while through an immoderate inclination   towards these good of the lowest order the better and higher are   forsakenThou our Lord God Thy truth and Thy law For these lower   thing have their delight but not like my God who made all thing   for in Him doth the righteous delight and He is the joy of the upright   in heart     When then we ask why a crime wa done we believe it not unless it   appear that there might have been some desire of obtaining some of those   which we called lower good or a fear of losing them For they are   beautiful and comely although compared with those higher and beatific   good they be abject and low A man hath murdered another why he   loved his wife or his estate or would rob for his own livelihood or   feared to lose some such thing by him or wronged wa on fire to be   revenged Would any commit murder upon no cause delighted simply in   murdering who would believe it for a for that furious and savage man   of whom it is said that he wa gratuitously evil and cruel yet is the   cause assigned lest saith he through idleness hand or heart should   grow inactive And to what end that through that practice of guilt   he might having taken the city attain to honour empire rich and   be freed from fear of the law and his embarrassment from domestic   need and consciousness of villainy So then not even Catiline   himself loved his own villainy but something else for whose sake he   did them     What then did wretched I so love in thee thou theft of mine thou deed   of darkness in that sixteenth year of my age Lovely thou wert not   because thou wert theft But art thou any thing that thus I speak to   thee Fair were the pear we stole because they were Thy creation Thou   fairest of all Creator of all Thou good God God the sovereign good   and my true good Fair were those pear but not them did my wretched   soul desire for I had store of better and those I gathered only that   I might steal For when gathered I flung them away my only feast   therein being my own sin which I wa pleased to enjoy For if aught   of those pear came within my mouth what sweetened it wa the sin   And now O Lord my God I enquire what in that theft delighted me and   behold it hath no loveliness I mean not such loveliness a in justice   and wisdom nor such a is in the mind and memory and sens and   animal life of man nor yet a the star are glorious and beautiful in   their orb or the earth or sea full of embryolife replacing by it   birth that which decayeth nay nor even that false and shadowy beauty   which belongeth to deceiving vice     For so doth pride imitate exaltedness whereas Thou alone art God   exalted over all Ambition what seek it but honour and glory   whereas Thou alone art to be honoured above all and glorious for   evermore The cruelty of the great would fain be feared but who is   to be feared but God alone out of whose power what can be wrested or   withdrawn when or where or whither or by whom The tenderness of   the wanton would fain be counted love yet is nothing more tender than   Thy charity nor is aught loved more healthfully than that Thy truth   bright and beautiful above all Curiosity make semblance of a desire   of knowledge whereas Thou supremely knowest all Yea ignorance   and foolishness itself is cloaked under the name of simplicity and   uninjuriousness because nothing is found more single than Thee and   what le injurious since they are his own work which injure the   sinner Yea sloth would fain be at rest but what stable rest besides   the Lord Luxury affect to be called plenty and abundance but Thou art   the fulness and neverfailing plenteousness of incorruptible pleasure   Prodigality present a shadow of liberality but Thou art the most   overflowing Giver of all good Covetousness would posse many thing   and Thou possessest all thing Envy dispute for excellency what more   excellent than Thou Anger seek revenge who revenge more justly   than Thou Fear startle at thing unwonted and sudden which endangers   thing beloved and take forethought for their safety but to Thee what   unwonted or sudden or who separateth from Thee what Thou lovest Or   where but with Thee is unshaken safety Grief pine away for thing   lost the delight of it desire because it would have nothing taken   from it a nothing can from Thee     Thus doth the soul commit fornication when she turn from Thee seeking   without Thee what she findeth not pure and untainted till she return   to Thee Thus all pervertedly imitate Thee who remove far from Thee   and lift themselves up against Thee But even by thus imitating Thee   they imply Thee to be the Creator of all nature whence there is no   place whither altogether to retire from Thee What then did I love in   that theft and wherein did I even corruptly and pervertedly imitate my   Lord Did I wish even by stealth to do contrary to Thy law because   by power I could not so that being a prisoner I might mimic a maimed   liberty by doing with impunity thing unpermitted me a darkened   likeness of Thy Omnipotency Behold Thy servant fleeing from his Lord   and obtaining a shadow O rottenness O monstrousness of life and depth   of death could I like what I might not only because I might not     What shall I render unto the Lord that whilst my memory recall these   thing my soul is not affrighted at them I will love Thee O Lord   and thank Thee and confess unto Thy name because Thou hast forgiven me   these so great and heinous deed of mine To Thy grace I ascribe it and   to Thy mercy that Thou hast melted away my sin a it were ice To Thy   grace I ascribe also whatsoever I have not done of evil for what might   I not have done who even loved a sin for it own sake Yea all I   confess to have been forgiven me both what evil I committed by my own   wilfulness and what by Thy guidance I committed not What man is   he who weighing his own infirmity dare to ascribe his purity and   innocency to his own strength that so he should love Thee the le a   if he had le needed Thy mercy whereby Thou remittest sin to those   that turn to Thee For whosoever called by Thee followed Thy voice   and avoided those thing which he read me recalling and confessing   of myself let him not scorn me who being sick wa cured by that   Physician through whose aid it wa that he wa not or rather wa le   sick and for this let him love Thee a much yea and more since by   whom he see me to have been recovered from such deep consumption of   sin by Him he see himself to have been from the like consumption of   sin preserved     What fruit had I then wretched man in those thing of the   remembrance whereof I am now ashamed Especially in that theft which   I loved for the theft sake and it too wa nothing and therefore the   more miserable I who loved it Yet alone I had not done it such wa I   then I remember alone I had never done it I loved then in it also   the company of the accomplice with whom I did it I did not then love   nothing else but the theft yea rather I did love nothing else for that   circumstance of the company wa also nothing What is in truth who can   teach me save He that enlighteneth my heart and discovereth it   dark corner What is it which hath come into my mind to enquire and   discus and consider For had I then loved the pear I stole   and wished to enjoy them I might have done it alone had the bare   commission of the theft sufficed to attain my pleasure nor needed   I have inflamed the itching of my desire by the excitement of   accomplice But since my pleasure wa not in those pear it wa in the   offence itself which the company of fellowsinners occasioned     What then wa this feeling For of a truth it wa too foul and woe wa   me who had it But yet what wa it Who can understand his error It   wa the sport which a it were tickled our heart that we beguiled   those who little thought what we were doing and much disliked it Why   then wa my delight of such sort that I did it not alone Because none   doth ordinarily laugh alone ordinarily no one yet laughter sometimes   master men alone and singly when no one whatever is with them if   anything very ludicrous present itself to their sens or mind Yet   I had not done this alone alone I had never done it Behold my God   before Thee the vivid remembrance of my soul alone I had never   committed that theft wherein what I stole pleased me not but that   I stole nor had it alone liked me to do it nor had I done it O   friendship too unfriendly thou incomprehensible inveigler of the soul   thou greediness to do mischief out of mirth and wantonness thou thirst   of others loss without lust of my own gain or revenge but when it is   said Lets go let do it we are ashamed not to be shameless     Who can disentangle that twisted and intricate knottiness Foul is it I   hate to think on it to look on it But Thee I long for O Righteousness   and Innocency beautiful and comely to all pure eye and of a   satisfaction unsating With Thee is rest entire and life imperturbable   Whoso enters into Thee enters into the joy of his Lord and shall not   fear and shall do excellently in the AllExcellent I sank away from   Thee and I wandered O my God too much astray from Thee my stay in   these day of my youth and I became to myself a barren land           BOOK III       To Carthage I came where there sang all around me in my ear a cauldron   of unholy love I loved not yet yet I loved to love and out of a   deepseated want I hated myself for wanting not I sought what I might   love in love with loving and safety I hated and a way without snare   For within me wa a famine of that inward food Thyself my God yet   through that famine I wa not hungered but wa without all longing for   incorruptible sustenance not because filled therewith but the more   empty the more I loathed it For this cause my soul wa sickly and full   of sore it miserably cast itself forth desiring to be scraped by the   touch of object of sense Yet if these had not a soul they would not   be object of love To love then and to be beloved wa sweet to   me but more when I obtained to enjoy the person I loved I defiled   therefore the spring of friendship with the filth of concupiscence and   I beclouded it brightness with the hell of lustfulness and thus   foul and unseemly I would fain through exceeding vanity be fine   and courtly I fell headlong then into the love wherein I longed to be   ensnared My God my Mercy with how much gall didst Thou out of Thy   great goodness besprinkle for me that sweetness For I wa both beloved   and secretly arrived at the bond of enjoying and wa with joy fettered   with sorrowbringing bond that I might be scourged with the iron   burning rod of jealousy and suspicion and fear and anger and   quarrel     Stageplays also carried me away full of image of my misery and of   fuel to my fire Why is it that man desire to be made sad beholding   doleful and tragical thing which yet himself would no mean suffer   yet he desire a a spectator to feel sorrow at them and this very   sorrow is his pleasure What is this but a miserable madness for a man   is the more affected with these action the le free he is from such   affection Howsoever when he suffers in his own person it us to be   styled misery when he compassionates others then it is mercy But what   sort of compassion is this for feigned and scenical passion for the   auditor is not called on to relieve but only to grieve and he applauds   the actor of these fiction the more the more he grief And if the   calamity of those person whether of old time or mere fiction   be so acted that the spectator is not moved to tear he go away   disgusted and criticising but if he be moved to passion he stay   intent and weeps for joy     Are grief then too loved Verily all desire joy Or whereas no man   like to be miserable is he yet pleased to be merciful which because   it can not be without passion for this reason alone are passion loved   This also spring from that vein of friendship But whither go that   vein whither flow it wherefore run it into that torrent of pitch   bubbling forth those monstrous tide of foul lustfulness into which it   is wilfully changed and transformed being of it own will precipitated   and corrupted from it heavenly clearness Shall compassion then be   put away by no mean Be grief then sometimes loved But beware of   uncleanness O my soul under the guardianship of my God the God of our   father who is to be praised and exalted above all for ever beware of   uncleanness For I have not now ceased to pity but then in the theatre   I rejoiced with lover when they wickedly enjoyed one another although   this wa imaginary only in the play And when they lost one another a   if very compassionate I sorrowed with them yet had my delight in both   But now I much more pity him that rejoiceth in his wickedness than him   who is thought to suffer hardship by missing some pernicious pleasure   and the loss of some miserable felicity This certainly is the truer   mercy but in it grief delight not For though he that grief for the   miserable be commended for his office of charity yet had he who is   genuinely compassionate rather there were nothing for him to grieve   for For if good will be ill willed which can never be then may   he who truly and sincerely commiserates wish there might be some   miserable that he might commiserate Some sorrow may then be allowed   none loved For thus dost Thou O Lord God who lovest soul far more   purely than we and hast more incorruptibly pity on them yet are   wounded with no sorrowfulness And who is sufficient for these thing     But I miserable then loved to grieve and sought out what to grieve   at when in anothers and that feigned and personated misery that   acting best pleased me and attracted me the most vehemently which   drew tear from me What marvel that an unhappy sheep straying from   Thy flock and impatient of Thy keeping I became infected with a foul   disease And hence the love of grief not such a should sink deep into   me for I loved not to suffer what I loved to look on but such a upon   hearing their fiction should lightly scratch the surface upon which   a on envenomed nail followed inflamed swelling impostumes and a   putrefied sore My life being such wa it life O my God     And Thy faithful mercy hovered over me afar Upon how grievous   iniquity consumed I myself pursuing a sacrilegious curiosity that   having forsaken Thee it might bring me to the treacherous abyss and   the beguiling service of devil to whom I sacrificed my evil action   and in all these thing Thou didst scourge me I dared even while Thy   solemnity were celebrated within the wall of Thy Church to desire   and to compass a business deserving death for it fruit for which Thou   scourgedst me with grievous punishment though nothing to my fault   O Thou my exceeding mercy my God my refuge from those terrible   destroyer among whom I wandered with a stiff neck withdrawing   further from Thee loving mine own way and not Thine loving a vagrant   liberty     Those study also which were accounted commendable had a view to   excelling in the court of litigation the more bepraised the craftier   Such is men blindness glorying even in their blindness And now I   wa chief in the rhetoric school whereat I joyed proudly and I swelled   with arrogancy though Lord Thou knowest far quieter and altogether   removed from the subvertings of those Subverters for this illomened   and devilish name wa the very badge of gallantry among whom I lived   with a shameless shame that I wa not even a they With them I lived   and wa sometimes delighted with their friendship whose doings I ever   did abhorie their subvertings wherewith they wantonly persecuted   the modesty of stranger which they disturbed by a gratuitous jeering   feeding thereon their malicious birth Nothing can be liker the very   action of devil than these What then could they be more truly called   than Subverters themselves subverted and altogether perverted first   the deceiving spirit secretly deriding and seducing them wherein   themselves delight to jeer at and deceive others     Among such a these in that unsettled age of mine learned I book   of eloquence wherein I desired to be eminent out of a damnable and   vainglorious end a joy in human vanity In the ordinary course of   study I fell upon a certain book of Cicero whose speech almost all   admire not so his heart This book of his contains an exhortation   to philosophy and is called Hortensius But this book altered my   affection and turned my prayer to Thyself O Lord and made me have   other purpose and desire Every vain hope at once became worthless to   me and I longed with an incredibly burning desire for an immortality of   wisdom and began now to arise that I might return to Thee For not   to sharpen my tongue which thing I seemed to be purchasing with my   mother allowance in that my nineteenth year my father being dead   two year before not to sharpen my tongue did I employ that book nor   did it infuse into me it style but it matter     How did I burn then my God how did I burn to remount from earthly   thing to Thee nor knew I what Thou wouldest do with me For with Thee   is wisdom But the love of wisdom is in Greek called philosophy   with which that book inflamed me Some there be that seduce through   philosophy under a great and smooth and honourable name colouring and   disguising their own error and almost all who in that and former age   were such are in that book censured and set forth there also is   made plain that wholesome advice of Thy Spirit by Thy good and devout   servant Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain   deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiment of the world   and not after Christ For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead   bodily And since at that time Thou O light of my heart knowest   Apostolic Scripture wa not known to me I wa delighted with that   exhortation so far only that I wa thereby strongly roused and   kindled and inflamed to love and seek and obtain and hold and   embrace not this or that sect but wisdom itself whatever it were and   this alone checked me thus unkindled that the name of Christ wa not   in it For this name according to Thy mercy O Lord this name of   my Saviour Thy Son had my tender heart even with my mother milk   devoutly drunk in and deeply treasured and whatsoever wa without that   name though never so learned polished or true took not entire hold   of me     I resolved then to bend my mind to the holy Scriptures that I might see   what they were But behold I see a thing not understood by the proud   nor laid open to child lowly in access in it recess lofty and   veiled with mystery and I wa not such a could enter into it or   stoop my neck to follow it step For not a I now speak did I feel   when I turned to those Scriptures but they seemed to me unworthy to be   compared to the stateliness of Tully for my swelling pride shrunk from   their lowliness nor could my sharp wit pierce the interior thereof Yet   were they such a would grow up in a little one But I disdained to be a   little one and swollen with pride took myself to be a great one     Therefore I fell among men proudly doting exceeding carnal and prating   in whose mouth were the snare of the Devil limed with the mixture of   the syllable of Thy name and of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Holy   Ghost the Paraclete our Comforter These name departed not out of   their mouth but so far forth a the sound only and the noise of the   tongue for the heart wa void of truth Yet they cried out Truth   Truth and spake much thereof to me yet it wa not in them but they   spake falsehood not of Thee only who truly art Truth but even of   those element of this world Thy creature And I indeed ought to have   passed by even philosopher who spake truth concerning them for love   of Thee my Father supremely good Beauty of all thing beautiful   O Truth Truth how inwardly did even then the marrow of my soul pant   after Thee when they often and diversely and in many and huge book   echoed of Thee to me though it wa but an echo And these were the   dish wherein to me hungering after Thee they instead of Thee   served up the Sun and Moon beautiful work of Thine but yet Thy work   not Thyself no nor Thy first work For Thy spiritual work are before   these corporeal work celestial though they be and shining But I   hungered and thirsted not even after those first work of Thine but   after Thee Thyself the Truth in whom is no variableness neither   shadow of turning yet they still set before me in those dish   glittering fantasy than which better were it to love this very sun   which is real to our sight at least than those fantasy which by   our eye deceive our mind Yet because I thought them to be Thee I fed   thereon not eagerly for Thou didst not in them taste to me a Thou   art for Thou wast not these emptiness nor wa I nourished by them   but exhausted rather Food in sleep show very like our food awake yet   are not those asleep nourished by it for they are asleep But those   were not even any way like to Thee a Thou hast now spoken to me for   those were corporeal fantasy false body than which these true   body celestial or terrestrial which with our fleshly sight we   behold are far more certain these thing the beast and bird discern   a well a we and they are more certain than when we fancy them And   again we do with more certainty fancy them than by them conjecture   other vaster and infinite body which have no being Such empty husk   wa I then fed on and wa not fed But Thou my soul Love in looking   for whom I fail that I may become strong art neither those body   which we see though in heaven nor those which we see not there for   Thou hast created them nor dost Thou account them among the chiefest of   Thy work How far then art Thou from those fantasy of mine fantasy   of body which altogether are not than which the image of those   body which are are far more certain and more certain still the   body themselves which yet Thou art not no nor yet the soul which   is the life of the body So then better and more certain is the life   of the body than the body But Thou art the life of soul the life   of life having life in Thyself and changest not life of my soul     Where then wert Thou then to me and how far from me Far verily wa I   straying from Thee barred from the very husk of the swine whom with   husk I fed For how much better are the fable of poet and grammarian   than these snare For verse and poem and Medea flying are more   profitable truly than these men five element variously disguised   answering to five den of darkness which have no being yet slay the   believer For verse and poem I can turn to true food and Medea   flying though I did sing I maintained not though I heard it sung   I believed not but those thing I did believe Woe woe by what step   wa I brought down to the depth of hell toiling and turmoiling through   want of Truth since I sought after Thee my God to Thee I confess   it who hadst mercy on me not a yet confessing not according to the   understanding of the mind wherein Thou willedst that I should excel   the beast but according to the sense of the flesh But Thou wert more   inward to me than my most inward part and higher than my highest I   lighted upon that bold woman simple and knoweth nothing shadowed out   in Solomon sitting at the door and saying Eat ye bread of secrecy   willingly and drink ye stolen water which are sweet she seduced me   because she found my soul dwelling abroad in the eye of my flesh and   ruminating on such food a through it I had devoured     For other than this that which really is I knew not and wa a it   were through sharpness of wit persuaded to assent to foolish deceiver   when they asked me whence is evil is God bounded by a bodily shape   and ha hair and nail are they to be esteemed righteous who had   many wife at once and did kill men and sacrifice living creature   At which I in my ignorance wa much troubled and departing from the   truth seemed to myself to be making towards it because a yet I knew   not that evil wa nothing but a privation of good until at last a thing   cease altogether to be which how should I see the sight of whose eye   reached only to body and of my mind to a phantasm And I knew not God   to be a Spirit not one who hath part extended in length and breadth   or whose being wa bulk for every bulk is le in a part than in the   whole and if it be infinite it must be le in such part a is defined   by a certain space than in it infinitude and so is not wholly every   where a Spirit a God And what that should be in u by which we   were like to God and might be rightly said to be after the image of   God I wa altogether ignorant     Nor knew I that true inward righteousness which judgeth not according   to custom but out of the most rightful law of God Almighty whereby   the way of place and time were disposed according to those time and   place itself meantime being the same always and every where not one   thing in one place and another in another according to which Abraham   and Isaac and Jacob and Moses and David were righteous and all   those commended by the mouth of God but were judged unrighteous by   silly men judging out of man judgment and measuring by their own   petty habit the moral habit of the whole human race As if in an   armory one ignorant what were adapted to each part should cover his   head with greave or seek to be shod with a helmet and complain that   they fitted not or a if on a day when business is publicly stopped in   the afternoon one were angered at not being allowed to keep open shop   because he had been in the forenoon or when in one house he observeth   some servant take a thing in his hand which the butler is not suffered   to meddle with or something permitted out of door which is forbidden   in the diningroom and should be angry that in one house and one   family the same thing is not allotted every where and to all Even   such are they who are fretted to hear something to have been lawful   for righteous men formerly which now is not or that God for certain   temporal respect commanded them one thing and these another obeying   both the same righteousness whereas they see in one man and one day   and one house different thing to be fit for different member and   a thing formerly lawful after a certain time not so in one corner   permitted or commanded but in another rightly forbidden and punished   Is justice therefore various or mutable No but the time over which   it presides flow not evenly because they are time But men whose day   are few upon the earth for that by their sens they can not harmonise   the cause of thing in former age and other nation which they had   not experience of with these which they have experience of whereas in   one and the same body day or family they easily see what is fitting   for each member and season part and person to the one they take   exception to the other they submit     These thing I then knew not nor observed they struck my sight on all   side and I saw them not I indited verse in which I might not place   every foot every where but differently in different metre nor even in   any one metre the selfsame foot in all place Yet the art itself by   which I indited had not different principle for these different case   but comprised all in one Still I saw not how that righteousness which   good and holy men obeyed did far more excellently and sublimely contain   in one all those thing which God commanded and in no part varied   although in varying time it prescribed not every thing at once but   apportioned and enjoined what wa fit for each And I in my blindness   censured the holy Fathers not only wherein they made use of thing   present a God commanded and inspired them but also wherein they were   foretelling thing to come a God wa revealing in them     Can it at any time or place be unjust to love God with all his heart   with all his soul and with all his mind and his neighbour a himself   Therefore are those foul offence which be against nature to be every   where and at all time detested and punished such a were those of the   men of Sodom which should all nation commit they should all stand   guilty of the same crime by the law of God which hath not so made men   that they should so abuse one another For even that intercourse which   should be between God and u is violated when that same nature of   which He is Author is polluted by perversity of lust But those   action which are offence against the custom of men are to be avoided   according to the custom severally prevailing so that a thing agreed   upon and confirmed by custom or law of any city or nation may not be   violated at the lawless pleasure of any whether native or foreigner   For any part which harmoniseth not with it whole is offensive But   when God command a thing to be done against the custom or compact of   any people though it were never by them done heretofore it is to be   done and if intermitted it is to be restored and if never ordained   is now to be ordained For lawful if it be for a king in the state   which he reign over to command that which no one before him nor he   himself heretofore had commanded and to obey him can not be against the   common weal of the state nay it were against it if he were not obeyed   for to obey prince is a general compact of human society how much   more unhesitatingly ought we to obey God in all which He command the   Ruler of all His creature For a among the power in man society   the greater authority is obeyed in preference to the lesser so must God   above all     So in act of violence where there is a wish to hurt whether by   reproach or injury and these either for revenge a one enemy against   another or for some profit belonging to another a the robber to   the traveller or to avoid some evil a towards one who is feared or   through envy a one le fortunate to one more so or one well thriven   in any thing to him whose being on a par with himself he fear or   grief at or for the mere pleasure at anothers pain a spectator   of gladiator or deriders and mocker of others These be the head   of iniquity which spring from the lust of the flesh of the eye or of   rule either singly or two combined or all together and so do men   live ill against the three and seven that psaltery of of ten string   Thy Ten Commandments O God most high and most sweet But what foul   offence can there be against Thee who canst not be defiled or   what act of violence against Thee who canst not be harmed But Thou   avengest what men commit against themselves seeing also when they sin   against Thee they do wickedly against their own soul and iniquity   give itself the lie by corrupting and perverting their nature which   Thou hast created and ordained or by an immoderate use of thing   allowed or in burning in thing unallowed to that use which is against   nature or are found guilty raging with heart and tongue against Thee   kicking against the prick or when bursting the pale of human society   they boldly joy in selfwilled combination or division according a   they have any object to gain or subject of offence And these thing are   done when Thou art forsaken O Fountain of Life who art the only and   true Creator and Governor of the Universe and by a selfwilled pride   any one false thing is selected therefrom and loved So then by a   humble devoutness we return to Thee and Thou cleansest u from our   evil habit and art merciful to their sin who confess and hearest the   groaning of the prisoner and loosest u from the chain which we made   for ourselves if we lift not up against Thee the horn of an unreal   liberty suffering the loss of all through covetousness of more by   loving more our own private good than Thee the Good of all     Amidst these offence of foulness and violence and so many iniquity   are sin of men who are on the whole making proficiency which by those   that judge rightly are after the rule of perfection discommended yet   the person commended upon hope of future fruit a in the green blade   of growing corn And there are some resembling offence of foulness or   violence which yet are no sin because they offend neither Thee our   Lord God nor human society when namely thing fitting for a given   period are obtained for the service of life and we know not whether out   of a lust of having or when thing are for the sake of correction by   constituted authority punished and we know not whether out of a lust of   hurting Many an action then which in men sight is disapproved is   by Thy testimony approved and many by men praised are Thou being   witness condemned because the show of the action and the mind of the   doer and the unknown exigency of the period severally vary But when   Thou on a sudden commandest an unwonted and unthought of thing yea   although Thou hast sometime forbidden it and still for the time hidest   the reason of Thy command and it be against the ordinance of some   society of men who doubt but it is to be done seeing that society   of men is just which serf Thee But blessed are they who know Thy   command For all thing were done by Thy servant either to show forth   something needful for the present or to foreshow thing to come     These thing I being ignorant of scoffed at those Thy holy servant and   prophet And what gained I by scoffing at them but to be scoffed at by   Thee being insensibly and step by step drawn on to those folly a   to believe that a figtree wept when it wa plucked and the tree it   mother shed milky tear Which fig notwithstanding plucked by some   others not his own guilt had some Manichaean saint eaten and   mingled with his bowel he should breathe out of it angel yea there   shall burst forth particle of divinity at every moan or groan in his   prayer which particle of the most high and true God had remained bound   in that fig unless they had been set at liberty by the teeth or belly   of some Elect saint And I miserable believed that more mercy wa   to be shown to the fruit of the earth than men for whom they were   created For if any one an hungered not a Manichaean should ask for   any that morsel would seem a it were condemned to capital punishment   which should be given him     And Thou sentest Thine hand from above and drewest my soul out of that   profound darkness my mother Thy faithful one weeping to Thee for me   more than mother weep the bodily death of their child For she   by that faith and spirit which she had from Thee discerned the death   wherein I lay and Thou heardest her O Lord Thou heardest her and   despisedst not her tear when streaming down they watered the ground   under her eye in every place where she prayed yea Thou heardest her   For whence wa that dream whereby Thou comfortedst her so that she   allowed me to live with her and to eat at the same table in the   house which she had begun to shrink from abhorring and detesting   the blasphemy of my error For she saw herself standing on a certain   wooden rule and a shining youth coming towards her cheerful and   smiling upon her herself grieving and overwhelmed with grief But he   having in order to instruct a is their wo nt not to be instructed   enquired of her the cause of her grief and daily tear and she   answering that she wa bewailing my perdition he bade her rest   contented and told her to look and observe That where she wa there   wa I also And when she looked she saw me standing by her in the same   rule Whence wa this but that Thine ear were towards her heart O   Thou Good omnipotent who so carest for every one of u a if Thou   caredst for him only and so for all a if they were but one     Whence wa this also that when she had told me this vision and I would   fain bend it to mean That she rather should not despair of being one   day what I wa she presently without any hesitation reply No   for it wa not told me that where he there thou also but where   thou there he also I confess to Thee O Lord that to the best of my   remembrance and I have oft spoken of this that Thy answer through   my waking motherthat she wa not perplexed by the plausibility of my   false interpretation and so quickly saw what wa to be seen and which   I certainly had not perceived before she spakeeven then moved me more   than the dream itself by which a joy to the holy woman to be fulfilled   so long after wa for the consolation of her present anguish so long   before foresignified For almost nine year passed in which I wallowed   in the mire of that deep pit and the darkness of falsehood often   assaying to rise but dashed down the more grievously All which time   that chaste godly and sober widow such a Thou lovest now more   cheered with hope yet no whit relaxing in her weeping and mourning   ceased not at all hour of her devotion to bewail my case unto Thee   And her prayer entered into Thy presence and yet Thou sufferedst me to   be yet involved and reinvolved in that darkness     Thou gavest her meantime another answer which I call to mind for much   I pas by hasting to those thing which more press me to confess unto   Thee and much I do not remember Thou gavest her then another answer   by a Priest of Thine a certain Bishop brought up in Thy Church   and well studied in Thy book Whom when this woman had entreated to   vouchsafe to converse with me refute my error unteach me ill thing   and teach me good thing for this he wa wo nt to do when he found   person fitted to receive it he refused wisely a I afterwards   perceived For he answered that I wa yet unteachable being puffed   up with the novelty of that heresy and had already perplexed diver   unskilful person with captious question a she had told him but   let him alone a while saith he only pray God for him he will of   himself by reading find what that error is and how great it impiety   At the same time he told her how himself when a little one had by his   seduced mother been consigned over to the Manichees and had not   only read but frequently copied out almost all their book and had   without any argument or proof from any one seen how much that sect wa   to be avoided and had avoided it Which when he had said and she would   not be satisfied but urged him more with entreaty and many tear   that he would see me and discourse with me he a little displeased at   her importunity saith Go thy way and God bless thee for it is not   possible that the son of these tear should perish Which answer she   took a she often mentioned in her conversation with me a if it had   sounded from heaven           BOOK IV       For this space of nine year from my nineteenth year to my   eightandtwentieth we lived seduced and seducing deceived and   deceiving in diver lust openly by science which they call liberal   secretly with a falsenamed religion here proud there superstitious   every where vain Here hunting after the emptiness of popular praise   down even to theatrical applause and poetic prize and strife for   grassy garland and the folly of show and the intemperance of   desire There desiring to be cleansed from these defilement by   carrying food to those who were called elect and holy out of which   in the workhouse of their stomach they should forge for u Angels   and Gods by whom we might be cleansed These thing did I follow and   practise with my friend deceived by me and with me Let the arrogant   mock me and such a have not been to their soul health stricken and   cast down by Thee O my God but I would still confess to Thee mine own   shame in Thy praise Suffer me I beseech Thee and give me grace to go   over in my present remembrance the wandering of my forepassed time   and to offer unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving For what am I to   myself without Thee but a guide to mine own downfall or what am I even   at the best but an infant sucking the milk Thou givest and feeding   upon Thee the food that perisheth not But what sort of man is any man   seeing he is but a man Let now the strong and the mighty laugh at u   but let u poor and needy confess unto Thee     In those year I taught rhetoric and overcome by cupidity made sale   of a loquacity to overcome by Yet I preferred Lord Thou knowest   honest scholar a they are accounted and these I without artifice   taught artifice not to be practised against the life of the guiltless   though sometimes for the life of the guilty And Thou O God from afar   perceivedst me stumbling in that slippery course and amid much smoke   sending out some spark of faithfulness which I showed in that my   guidance of such a loved vanity and sought after leasing myself their   companion In those year I had onenot in that which is called   lawful marriage but whom I had found out in a wayward passion void of   understanding yet but one remaining faithful even to her in whom I   in my own case experienced what difference there is betwixt the   selfrestraint of the marriagecovenant for the sake of issue and   the bargain of a lustful love where child are born against their   parent will although once born they constrain love     I remember also that when I had settled to enter the list for a   theatrical prize some wizard asked me what I would give him to win but   I detesting and abhorring such foul mystery answered Though the   garland were of imperishable gold I would not suffer a fly to be   killed to gain me it For he wa to kill some living creature in his   sacrifice and by those honour to invite the devil to favour me But   this ill also I rejected not out of a pure love for Thee O God of my   heart for I knew not how to love Thee who knew not how to conceive   aught beyond a material brightness And doth not a soul sighing after   such fiction commit fornication against Thee trust in thing unreal   and feed the wind Still I would not forsooth have sacrifice offered   to devil for me to whom I wa sacrificing myself by that superstition   For what else is it to feed the wind but to feed them that is by going   astray to become their pleasure and derision     Those impostor then whom they style Mathematicians I consulted   without scruple because they seemed to use no sacrifice nor to pray to   any spirit for their divination which art however Christian and   true piety consistently reject and condemns For it is a good thing to   confess unto Thee and to say Have mercy upon me heal my soul for I   have sinned against Thee and not to abuse Thy mercy for a licence to   sin but to remember the Lords word Behold thou art made whole sin   no more lest a worse thing come unto thee All which wholesome advice   they labour to destroy saying The cause of thy sin is inevitably   determined in heaven and This did Venus or Saturn or Mars   that man forsooth flesh and blood and proud corruption might be   blameless while the Creator and Ordainer of heaven and the star is   to bear the blame And who is He but our God the very sweetness and   wellspring of righteousness who renderest to every man according to   his work and a broken and contrite heart wilt Thou not despise     There wa in those day a wise man very skilful in physic and renowned   therein who had with his own proconsular hand put the Agonistic garland   upon my distempered head but not a a physician for this disease Thou   only curest who resistest the proud and givest grace to the humble   But didst Thou fail me even by that old man or forbear to heal my soul   For having become more acquainted with him and hanging assiduously and   fixedly on his speech for though in simple term it wa vivid lively   and earnest when he had gathered by my discourse that I wa given to   the book of nativitycasters he kindly and fatherly advised me to cast   them away and not fruitlessly bestow a care and diligence necessary   for useful thing upon these vanity saying that he had in his   earliest year studied that art so a to make it the profession whereby   he should live and that understanding Hippocrates he could soon have   understood such a study a this and yet he had given it over and taken   to physic for no other reason but that he found it utterly false   and he a grave man would not get his living by deluding people But   thou saith he hast rhetoric to maintain thyself by so that thou   followest this of free choice not of necessity the more then oughtest   thou to give me credit herein who laboured to acquire it so perfectly   a to get my living by it alone Of whom when I had demanded how then   could many true thing be foretold by it he answered me a he could   that the force of chance diffused throughout the whole order of   thing brought this about For if when a man by haphazard open the   page of some poet who sang and thought of something wholly different   a verse oftentimes fell out wondrously agreeable to the present   business it were not to be wondered at if out of the soul of man   unconscious what take place in it by some higher instinct an answer   should be given by hap not by art corresponding to the business and   action of the demander     And thus much either from or through him Thou conveyedst to me and   tracedst in my memory what I might hereafter examine for myself But at   that time neither he nor my dearest Nebridius a youth singularly good   and of a holy fear who derided the whole body of divination could   persuade me to cast it aside the authority of the author swaying me   yet more and a yet I had found no certain proof such a I sought   whereby it might without all doubt appear that what had been truly   foretold by those consulted wa the result of haphazard not of the art   of the stargazer     In those year when I first began to teach rhetoric in my native town   I had made one my friend but too dear to me from a community of   pursuit of mine own age and a myself in the first opening flower   of youth He had grown up of a child with me and we had been both   schoolfellow and playfellow But he wa not yet my friend a   afterwards nor even then a true friendship is for true it can not be   unless in such a Thou cementest together cleaving unto Thee by that   love which is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost which is   given unto u Yet wa it but too sweet ripened by the warmth of   kindred study for from the true faith which he a a youth had   not soundly and thoroughly imbibed I had warped him also to those   superstitious and pernicious fable for which my mother bewailed me   With me he now erred in mind nor could my soul be without him But   behold Thou wert close on the step of Thy fugitive at once God of   vengeance and Fountain of mercy turning u to Thyself by wonderful   mean Thou tookest that man out of this life when he had scarce filled   up one whole year of my friendship sweet to me above all sweetness of   that my life     Who can recount all Thy praise which he hath felt in his one self   What diddest Thou then my God and how unsearchable is the abyss of   Thy judgment For long sore sick of a fever he lay senseless in   a deathsweat and his recovery being despaired of he wa baptised   unknowing myself meanwhile little regarding and presuming that his   soul would retain rather what it had received of me not what wa   wrought on his unconscious body But it proved far otherwise for he wa   refreshed and restored Forthwith a soon a I could speak with him   and I could so soon a he wa able for I never left him and we hung   but too much upon each other I essayed to jest with him a though he   would jest with me at that baptism which he had received when utterly   absent in mind and feeling but had now understood that he had received   But he so shrunk from me a from an enemy and with a wonderful and   sudden freedom bade me a I would continue his friend forbear such   language to him I all astonished and amazed suppressed all my   emotion till he should grow well and his health were strong enough for   me to deal with him a I would But he wa taken away from my frenzy   that with Thee he might be preserved for my comfort a few day after in   my absence he wa attacked again by the fever and so departed     At this grief my heart wa utterly darkened and whatever I beheld wa   death My native country wa a torment to me and my father house a   strange unhappiness and whatever I had shared with him wanting him   became a distracting torture Mine eye sought him every where but he   wa not granted them and I hated all place for that they had not him   nor could they now tell me he is coming a when he wa alive and   absent I became a great riddle to myself and I asked my soul why she   wa so sad and why she disquieted me sorely but she knew not what to   answer me And if I said Trust in God she very rightly obeyed me not   because that most dear friend whom she had lost wa being man both   truer and better than that phantasm she wa bid to trust in Only tear   were sweet to me for they succeeded my friend in the dearest of my   affection     And now Lord these thing are passed by and time hath assuaged my   wound May I learn from Thee who art Truth and approach the ear of my   heart unto Thy mouth that Thou mayest tell me why weeping is sweet to   the miserable Hast Thou although present every where cast away our   misery far from Thee And Thou abidest in Thyself but we are tossed   about in diver trial And yet unless we mourned in Thine ear we   should have no hope left Whence then is sweet fruit gathered from the   bitterness of life from groaning tear sigh and complaint Doth   this sweeten it that we hope Thou hearest This is true of prayer for   therein is a longing to approach unto Thee But is it also in grief for   a thing lost and the sorrow wherewith I wa then overwhelmed For I   neither hoped he should return to life nor did I desire this with my   tear but I wept only and grieved For I wa miserable and had lost my   joy Or is weeping indeed a bitter thing and for very loathing of the   thing which we before enjoyed doe it then when we shrink from them   please u     But what speak I of these thing for now is no time to question but to   confess unto Thee Wretched I wa and wretched is every soul bound by   the friendship of perishable thing he is torn asunder when he loses   them and then he feel the wretchedness which he had ere yet he lost   them So wa it then with me I wept most bitterly and found my repose   in bitterness Thus wa I wretched and that wretched life I held dearer   than my friend For though I would willingly have changed it yet wa I   more unwilling to part with it than with him yea I know not whether I   would have parted with it even for him a is related if not feigned   of Pylades and Orestes that they would gladly have died for each other   or together not to live together being to them worse than death But in   me there had arisen some unexplained feeling too contrary to this for   at once I loathed exceedingly to live and feared to die I suppose the   more I loved him the more did I hate and fear a a most cruel enemy   death which had bereaved me of him and I imagined it would speedily   make an end of all men since it had power over him Thus wa it with   me I remember Behold my heart O my God behold and see into me for   well I remember it O my Hope who cleansest me from the impurity of   such affection directing mine eye towards Thee and plucking my foot   out of the snare For I wondered that others subject to death did   live since he whom I loved a if he should never die wa dead and I   wondered yet more that myself who wa to him a second self could live   he being dead Well said one of his friend Thou half of my soul   for I felt that my soul and his soul were one soul in two body and   therefore wa my life a horror to me because I would not live halved   And therefore perchance I feared to die lest he whom I had much loved   should die wholly     O madness which knowest not how to love men like men O foolish man   that I then wa enduring impatiently the lot of man I fretted then   sighed wept wa distracted had neither rest nor counsel For I bore   about a shattered and bleeding soul impatient of being borne by me yet   where to repose it I found not Not in calm grove not in game and   music nor in fragrant spot nor in curious banqueting nor in the   pleasure of the bed and the couch nor finally in book or poesy   found it repose All thing looked ghastly yea the very light   whatsoever wa not what he wa wa revolting and hateful except   groaning and tear For in those alone found I a little refreshment But   when my soul wa withdrawn from them a huge load of misery weighed   me down To Thee O Lord it ought to have been raised for Thee to   lighten I knew it but neither could nor would the more since when I   thought of Thee Thou wert not to me any solid or substantial thing For   Thou wert not Thyself but a mere phantom and my error wa my God If   I offered to discharge my load thereon that it might rest it glided   through the void and came rushing down again on me and I had remained   to myself a hapless spot where I could neither be nor be from thence   For whither should my heart flee from my heart Whither should I   flee from myself Whither not follow myself And yet I fled out of my   country for so should mine eye le look for him where they were not   wo nt to see him And thus from Thagaste I came to Carthage     Times lose no time nor do they roll idly by through our sens they   work strange operation on the mind Behold they went and came day by   day and by coming and going introduced into my mind other imagination   and other remembrance and little by little patched me up again with my   old kind of delight unto which that my sorrow gave way And yet there   succeeded not indeed other grief yet the cause of other grief For   whence had that former grief so easily reached my very inmost soul but   that I had poured out my soul upon the dust in loving one that must   die a if he would never die For what restored and refreshed me   chiefly wa the solace of other friend with whom I did love what   instead of Thee I loved and this wa a great fable and protracted lie   by whose adulterous stimulus our soul which lay itching in our ear   wa being defiled But that fable would not die to me so oft a any of   my friend died There were other thing which in them did more take my   mind to talk and jest together to do kind office by turn to read   together honied book to play the fool or be earnest together to   dissent at time without discontent a a man might with his own self   and even with the seldomness of these dissentings to season our more   frequent consentings sometimes to teach and sometimes learn long for   the absent with impatience and welcome the coming with joy These and   the like expression proceeding out of the heart of those that loved   and were loved again by the countenance the tongue the eye and   a thousand pleasing gesture were so much fuel to melt our soul   together and out of many make but one     This is it that is loved in friend and so loved that a man   conscience condemns itself if he love not him that love him again or   love not again him that love him looking for nothing from his person   but indication of his love Hence that mourning if one die and   darkening of sorrow that steeping of the heart in tear all   sweetness turned to bitterness and upon the loss of life of the dying   the death of the living Blessed whoso loveth Thee and his friend in   Thee and his enemy for Thee For he alone loses none dear to him to   whom all are dear in Him who can not be lost And who is this but our   God the God that made heaven and earth and filleth them because by   filling them He created them Thee none loseth but who leaveth And   who leaveth Thee whither goeth or whither fleeth he but from Thee   wellpleased to Thee displeased For where doth he not find Thy law in   his own punishment And Thy law is truth and truth Thou     Turn u O God of Hosts show u Thy countenance and we shall be whole   For whithersoever the soul of man turn itself unless toward Thee it   is riveted upon sorrow yea though it is riveted on thing beautiful   And yet they out of Thee and out of the soul were not unless they   were from Thee They rise and set and by rising they begin a it were   to be they grow that they may be perfected and perfected they wax   old and wither and all grow not old but all wither So then when they   rise and tend to be the more quickly they grow that they may be so   much the more they haste not to be This is the law of them Thus much   ha Thou allotted them because they are portion of thing which   exist not all at once but by passing away and succeeding they together   complete that universe whereof they are portion And even thus is our   speech completed by sign giving forth a sound but this again is not   perfected unless one word pas away when it hath sounded it part that   another may succeed Out of all these thing let my soul praise Thee   O God Creator of all yet let not my soul be riveted unto these thing   with the glue of love through the sens of the body For they go   whither they were to go that they might not be and they rend her with   pestilent longing because she longs to be yet love to repose in what   she love But in these thing is no place of repose they abide not   they flee and who can follow them with the sens of the flesh yea   who can grasp them when they are hard by For the sense of the flesh is   slow because it is the sense of the flesh and thereby is it bounded   It sufficeth for that it wa made for but it sufficeth not to stay   thing running their course from their appointed startingplace to the   end appointed For in Thy Word by which they are created they hear   their decree hence and hitherto     Be not foolish O my soul nor become deaf in the ear of thine heart   with the tumult of thy folly Hearken thou too     The Word itself calleth thee to return and there is the place of rest   imperturbable where love is not forsaken if itself forsaketh not   Behold these thing pas away that others may replace them and so   this lower universe be completed by all his part But do I depart any   whither saith the Word of God There fix thy dwelling trust there   whatsoever thou hast thence O my soul at least now thou art tired out   with vanity Entrust Truth whatsoever thou hast from the Truth and   thou shalt lose nothing and thy decay shall bloom again and all thy   disease be healed and thy mortal part be reformed and renewed and   bound around thee nor shall they lay thee whither themselves descend   but they shall stand fast with thee and abide for ever before God Who   abideth and standeth fast for ever     Why then be perverted and follow thy flesh Be it converted and follow   thee Whatever by her thou hast sense of is in part and the whole   whereof these are part thou knowest not and yet they delight thee   But had the sense of thy flesh a capacity for comprehending the whole   and not itself also for thy punishment been justly restricted to   a part of the whole thou wouldest that whatsoever existeth at this   present should pas away that so the whole might better please thee   For what we speak also by the same sense of the flesh thou hearest yet   wouldest not thou have the syllable stay but fly away that others may   come and thou hear the whole And so ever when any one thing is made   up of many all of which do not exist together all collectively would   please more than they do severally could all be perceived collectively   But far better than these is He who made all and He is our God nor   doth He pas away for neither doth aught succeed Him     If body please thee praise God on occasion of them and turn back   thy love upon their Maker lest in these thing which please thee thou   displease If soul please thee be they loved in God for they too are   mutable but in Him are they firmly stablished else would they pas   and pas away In Him then be they beloved and carry unto Him along   with thee what soul thou canst and say to them Him let u love Him   let u love He made these nor is He far off For He did not make them   and so depart but they are of Him and in Him See there He is where   truth is loved He is within the very heart yet hath the heart strayed   from Him Go back into your heart ye transgressor and cleave fast to   Him that made you Stand with Him and ye shall stand fast Rest in Him   and ye shall be at rest Whither go ye in rough way Whither go ye   The good that you love is from Him but it is good and pleasant through   reference to Him and justly shall it be embittered because unjustly is   any thing loved which is from Him if He be forsaken for it To what end   then would ye still and still walk these difficult and toilsome way   There is no rest where ye seek it Seek what ye seek but it is not   there where ye seek Ye seek a blessed life in the land of death it is   not there For how should there be a blessed life where life itself is   not     But our true Life came down hither and bore our death and slew him   out of the abundance of His own life and He thundered calling aloud to   u to return hence to Him into that secret place whence He came forth   to u first into the Virgins womb wherein He espoused the human   creation our mortal flesh that it might not be for ever mortal and   thence like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber rejoicing a a giant   to run his course For He lingered not but ran calling aloud by word   deed death life descent ascension cry aloud to u to return   unto Him And He departed from our eye that we might return into our   heart and there find Him For He departed and lo He is here He would   not be long with u yet left u not for He departed thither whence   He never parted because the world wa made by Him And in this world   He wa and into this world He came to save sinner unto whom my soul   confesseth and He healeth it for it hath sinned against Him O ye son   of men how long so slow of heart Even now after the descent of Life   to you will ye not ascend and live But whither ascend ye when ye are   on high and set your mouth against the heaven Descend that ye may   ascend and ascend to God For ye have fallen by ascending against   Him Tell them this that they may weep in the valley of tear and   so carry them up with thee unto God because out of His spirit thou   speakest thus unto them if thou speakest burning with the fire of   charity     These thing I then knew not and I loved these lower beauty and I   wa sinking to the very depth and to my friend I said Do we love   any thing but the beautiful What then is the beautiful and what is   beauty What is it that attracts and win u to the thing we love for   unless there were in them a grace and beauty they could by no   mean draw u unto them And I marked and perceived that in body   themselves there wa a beauty from their forming a sort of whole and   again another from apt and mutual correspondence a of a part of   the body with it whole or a shoe with a foot and the like And this   consideration sprang up in my mind out of my inmost heart and I wrote   on the fair and fit I think two or three book Thou knowest O   Lord for it is gone from me for I have them not but they are strayed   from me I know not how     But what moved me O Lord my God to dedicate these book unto Hierius   an orator of Rome whom I knew not by face but loved for the fame   of his learning which wa eminent in him and some word of his I had   heard which pleased me But more did he please me for that he pleased   others who highly extolled him amazed that out of a Syrian first   instructed in Greek eloquence should afterwards be formed a wonderful   Latin orator and one most learned in thing pertaining unto philosophy   One is commended and unseen he is loved doth this love enter the   heart of the hearer from the mouth of the commender Not so But by one   who loveth is another kindled For hence he is loved who is commended   when the commender is believed to extol him with an unfeigned heart   that is when one that love him praise him     For so did I then love men upon the judgment of men not Thine O my   God in Whom no man is deceived But yet why not for quality like   those of a famous charioteer or fighter with beast in the theatre   known far and wide by a vulgar popularity but far otherwise and   earnestly and so a I would be myself commended For I would not be   commended or loved a actor are though I myself did commend and love   them but had rather be unknown than so known and even hated than   so loved Where now are the impulse to such various and diver kind of   love laid up in one soul Why since we are equally men do I love   in another what if I did not hate I should not spurn and cast from   myself For it hold not that a a good horse is loved by him who   would not though he might be that horse therefore the same may be   said of an actor who share our nature Do I then love in a man what I   hate to be who am a man Man himself is a great deep whose very hair   Thou numberest O Lord and they fall not to the ground without Thee   And yet are the hair of his head easier to be numbered than his   feeling and the beating of his heart     But that orator wa of that sort whom I loved a wishing to be myself   such and I erred through a swelling pride and wa tossed about with   every wind but yet wa steered by Thee though very secretly And   whence do I know and whence do I confidently confess unto Thee that   I had loved him more for the love of his commenders than for the very   thing for which he wa commended Because had he been unpraised and   these selfsame men had dispraised him and with dispraise and contempt   told the very same thing of him I had never been so kindled and   excited to love him And yet the thing had not been other nor he   himself other but only the feeling of the relators See where the   impotent soul lie along that is not yet stayed up by the solidity   of truth Just a the gale of tongue blow from the breast of the   opinionative so is it carried this way and that driven forward and   backward and the light is overclouded to it and the truth unseen And   lo it is before u And it wa to me a great matter that my discourse   and labour should be known to that man which should he approve I were   the more kindled but if he disapproved my empty heart void of Thy   solidity had been wounded And yet the fair and fit whereon I wrote   to him I dwelt on with pleasure and surveyed it and admired it   though none joined therein     But I saw not yet whereon this weighty matter turned in Thy wisdom   O Thou Omnipotent who only doest wonder and my mind ranged through   corporeal form and fair I defined and distinguished what is so   in itself and fit whose beauty is in correspondence to some other   thing and this I supported by corporeal example And I turned to   the nature of the mind but the false notion which I had of spiritual   thing let me not see the truth Yet the force of truth did of itself   flash into mine eye and I turned away my panting soul from incorporeal   substance to lineament and colour and bulky magnitude And not   being able to see these in the mind I thought I could not see my mind   And whereas in virtue I loved peace and in viciousness I abhorred   discord in the first I observed a unity but in the other a sort   of division And in that unity I conceived the rational soul and the   nature of truth and of the chief good to consist but in this division   I miserably imagined there to be some unknown substance of irrational   life and the nature of the chief evil which should not only be a   substance but real life also and yet not derived from Thee O my God   of whom are all thing And yet that first I called a Monad a it had   been a soul without sex but the latter a Duadanger in deed of   violence and in flagitiousness lust not knowing whereof I spake For   I had not known or learned that neither wa evil a substance nor our   soul that chief and unchangeable good     For a deed of violence arise if that emotion of the soul be   corrupted whence vehement action spring stirring itself insolently   and unrulily and lust when that affection of the soul is ungoverned   whereby carnal pleasure are drunk in so do error and false opinion   defile the conversation if the reasonable soul itself be corrupted a   it wa then in me who knew not that it must be enlightened by another   light that it may be partaker of truth seeing itself is not that   nature of truth For Thou shalt light my candle O Lord my God Thou   shalt enlighten my darkness and of Thy fulness have we all received   for Thou art the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the   world for in Thee there is no variableness neither shadow of change     But I pressed towards Thee and wa thrust from Thee that I might taste   of death for thou resistest the proud But what prouder than for me   with a strange madness to maintain myself to be that by nature which   Thou art For whereas I wa subject to change so much being manifest   to me my very desire to become wise being the wish of worse to become   better yet chose I rather to imagine Thee subject to change and   myself not to be that which Thou art Therefore I wa repelled by Thee   and Thou resistedst my vain stiffneckedness and I imagined corporeal   form and myself flesh I accused flesh and a wind that passeth   away I returned not to Thee but I passed on and on to thing which   have no being neither in Thee nor in me nor in the body Neither were   they created for me by Thy truth but by my vanity devised out of   thing corporeal And I wa wo nt to ask Thy faithful little one my   fellowcitizens from whom unknown to myself I stood exiled I wa   wo nt prating and foolishly to ask them Why then doth the soul err   which God created But I would not be asked Why then doth God   err And I maintained that Thy unchangeable substance did err upon   constraint rather than confess that my changeable substance had gone   astray voluntarily and now in punishment lay in error     I wa then some six or seven and twenty year old when I wrote those   volume revolving within me corporeal fiction buzzing in the ear   of my heart which I turned O sweet truth to thy inward melody   meditating on the fair and fit and longing to stand and hearken to   Thee and to rejoice greatly at the Bridegrooms voice but could not   for by the voice of mine own error I wa hurried abroad and through   the weight of my own pride I wa sinking into the lowest pit For Thou   didst not make me to hear joy and gladness nor did the bone exult   which were not yet humbled     And what did it profit me that scarce twenty year old a book of   Aristotle which they call the ten Predicaments falling into my hand   on whose very name I hung a on something great and divine so often   a my rhetoric master of Carthage and others accounted learned   mouthed it with cheek bursting with pride I read and understood it   unaided And on my conferring with others who said that they scarcely   understood it with very able tutor not only orally explaining it but   drawing many thing in sand they could tell me no more of it than I had   learned reading it by myself And the book appeared to me to speak very   clearly of substance such a man and of their quality a the   figure of a man of what sort it is and stature how many foot high   and his relationship whose brother he is or where placed or when   born or whether he stand or sits or be shod or armed or doe or   suffers anything and all the innumerable thing which might be ranged   under these nine Predicaments of which I have given some specimen or   under that chief Predicament of Substance     What did all this further me seeing it even hindered me when   imagining whatever wa wa comprehended under those ten Predicaments   I essayed in such wise to understand O my God Thy wonderful and   unchangeable Unity also a if Thou also hadst been subjected to Thine   own greatness or beauty so that a in body they should exist in   Thee a their subject whereas Thou Thyself art Thy greatness and   beauty but a body is not great or fair in that it is a body seeing   that though it were le great or fair it should notwithstanding be   a body But it wa falsehood which of Thee I conceived not truth   fiction of my misery not the reality of Thy blessedness For Thou   hadst commanded and it wa done in me that the earth should bring   forth briar and thorn to me and that in the sweat of my brow I   should eat my bread     And what did it profit me that all the book I could procure of the   socalled liberal art I the vile slave of vile affection read by   myself and understood And I delighted in them but knew not whence   came all that therein wa true or certain For I had my back to the   light and my face to the thing enlightened whence my face with which   I discerned the thing enlightened itself wa not enlightened   Whatever wa written either on rhetoric or logic geometry music   and arithmetic by myself without much difficulty or any instructor   I understood Thou knowest O Lord my God because both quickness of   understanding and acuteness in discerning is Thy gift yet did I not   thence sacrifice to Thee So then it served not to my use but rather   to my perdition since I went about to get so good a portion of my   substance into my own keeping and I kept not my strength for Thee but   wandered from Thee into a far country to spend it upon harlotry For   what profited me good ability not employed to good us For I felt   not that those art were attained with great difficulty even by the   studious and talented until I attempted to explain them to such when   he most excelled in them who followed me not altogether slowly     But what did this further me imagining that Thou O Lord God the   Truth wert a vast and bright body and I a fragment of that body   Perverseness too great But such wa I Nor do I blush O my God to   confess to Thee Thy mercy towards me and to call upon Thee who   blushed not then to profess to men my blasphemy and to bark against   Thee What profited me then my nimble wit in those science and all   those most knotty volume unravelled by me without aid from human   instruction seeing I erred so foully and with such sacrilegious   shamefulness in the doctrine of piety Or what hindrance wa a far   slower wit to Thy little one since they departed not far from Thee   that in the nest of Thy Church they might securely be fledged and   nourish the wing of charity by the food of a sound faith O Lord our   God under the shadow of Thy wing let u hope protect u and carry   u Thou wilt carry u both when little and even to hoar hair wilt   Thou carry u for our firmness when it is Thou then is it firmness   but when our own it is infirmity Our good ever life with Thee   from which when we turn away we are turned aside Let u now O Lord   return that we may not be overturned because with Thee our good life   without any decay which good art Thou nor need we fear lest there   be no place whither to return because we fell from it for through our   absence our mansion fell notThy eternity           BOOK V       Accept the sacrifice of my confession from the ministry of my tongue   which Thou hast formed and stirred up to confess unto Thy name Heal   Thou all my bone and let them say O Lord who is like unto Thee For   he who confesses to Thee doth not teach Thee what take place within   him seeing a closed heart close not out Thy eye nor can man   hardheartedness thrust back Thy hand for Thou dissolvest it at Thy   will in pity or in vengeance and nothing can hide itself from Thy heat   But let my soul praise Thee that it may love Thee and let it confess   Thy own mercy to Thee that it may praise Thee Thy whole creation   ceaseth not nor is silent in Thy praise neither the spirit of man   with voice directed unto Thee nor creation animate or inanimate by the   voice of those who meditate thereon that so our soul may from their   weariness arise towards Thee leaning on those thing which Thou hast   created and passing on to Thyself who madest them wonderfully and   there is refreshment and true strength     Let the restless the godless depart and flee from Thee yet Thou seest   them and dividest the darkness And behold the universe with them is   fair though they are foul And how have they injured Thee or how have   they disgraced Thy government which from the heaven to this lowest   earth is just and perfect For whither fled they when they fled from   Thy presence or where dost not Thou find them But they fled that they   might not see Thee seeing them and blinded might stumble against Thee   because Thou forsakest nothing Thou hast made that the unjust I say   might stumble upon Thee and justly be hurt withdrawing themselves from   thy gentleness and stumbling at Thy uprightness and falling upon their   own ruggedness Ignorant in truth that Thou art every where Whom no   place encompasseth and Thou alone art near even to those that remove   far from Thee Let them then be turned and seek Thee because not a   they have forsaken their Creator hast Thou forsaken Thy creation Let   them be turned and seek Thee and behold Thou art there in their heart   in the heart of those that confess to Thee and cast themselves upon   Thee and weep in Thy bosom after all their rugged way Then dost   Thou gently wipe away their tear and they weep the more and joy   in weeping even for that Thou Lordnot man of flesh and blood   butThou Lord who madest them remakest and comfortest them But   where wa I when I wa seeking Thee And Thou wert before me but I had   gone away from Thee nor did I find myself how much le Thee     I would lay open before my God that nineandtwentieth year of mine   age There had then come to Carthage a certain Bishop of the Manichees   Faustus by name a great snare of the Devil and many were entangled   by him through that lure of his smooth language which though I did   commend yet could I separate from the truth of the thing which I wa   earnest to learn nor did I so much regard the service of oratory a the   science which this Faustus so praised among them set before me to   feed upon Fame had before bespoken him most knowing in all valuable   learning and exquisitely skilled in the liberal science And since I   had read and well remembered much of the philosopher I compared some   thing of theirs with those long fable of the Manichees and found the   former the more probable even although they could only prevail so far   a to make judgment of this lower world the Lord of it they could by   no mean find out For Thou art great O Lord and hast respect unto the   humble but the proud Thou beholdest afar off Nor dost Thou draw near   but to the contrite in heart nor art found by the proud no not though   by curious skill they could number the star and the sand and measure   the starry heaven and track the course of the planet     For with their understanding and wit which Thou bestowedst on them   they search out these thing and much have they found out and   foretold many year before eclipse of those luminary the sun   and moonwhat day and hour and how many digitsnor did their   calculation fail and it came to pas a they foretold and they wrote   down the rule they had found out and these are read at this day and   out of them do others foretell in what year and month of the year and   what day of the month and what hour of the day and what part of it   light moon or sun is to be eclipsed and so it shall be a it is   foreshowed At these thing men that know not this art marvel and are   astonished and they that know it exult and are puffed up and by   an ungodly pride departing from Thee and failing of Thy light they   foresee a failure of the sun light which shall be so long before   but see not their own which is For they search not religiously whence   they have the wit wherewith they search out this And finding that Thou   madest them they give not themselves up to Thee to preserve what Thou   madest nor sacrifice to Thee what they have made themselves nor slay   their own soaring imagination a fowl of the air nor their own   diving curiosity wherewith like the fish of the sea they wander   over the unknown path of the abyss nor their own luxuriousness a   beast of the field that Thou Lord a consuming fire mayest burn up   those dead care of theirs and recreate themselves immortally     But they knew not the way Thy Word by Whom Thou madest these thing   which they number and themselves who number and the sense whereby   they perceive what they number and the understanding out of which they   number or that of Thy wisdom there is no number But the Only Begotten   is Himself made unto u wisdom and righteousness and sanctification   and wa numbered among u and paid tribute unto Caesar They knew not   this way whereby to descend to Him from themselves and by Him ascend   unto Him They knew not this way and deemed themselves exalted amongst   the star and shining and behold they fell upon the earth and their   foolish heart wa darkened They discourse many thing truly concerning   the creature but Truth Artificer of the creature they seek not   piously and therefore find Him not or if they find Him knowing Him   to be God they glorify Him not a God neither are thankful but   become vain in their imagination and profess themselves to be wise   attributing to themselves what is Thine and thereby with most perverse   blindness study to impute to Thee what is their own forging lie of   Thee who art the Truth and changing the glory of uncorruptible God   into an image made like corruptible man and to bird and fourfooted   beast and creeping thing changing Thy truth into a lie and   worshipping and serving the creature more than the Creator     Yet many truth concerning the creature retained I from these men and   saw the reason thereof from calculation the succession of time and   the visible testimony of the star and compared them with the saying   of Manichaeus which in his frenzy he had written most largely on these   subject but discovered not any account of the solstice or equinox   or the eclipse of the greater light nor whatever of this sort I   had learned in the book of secular philosophy But I wa commanded to   believe and yet it corresponded not with what had been established by   calculation and my own sight but wa quite contrary     Doth then O Lord God of truth whoso knoweth these thing therefore   please Thee Surely unhappy is he who knoweth all these and knoweth not   Thee but happy whoso knoweth Thee though he know not these And whoso   knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for them but for Thee   only if knowing Thee he glorifies Thee a God and is thankful and   becomes not vain in his imagination For a he is better off who know   how to posse a tree and return thanks to Thee for the use thereof   although he know not how many cubit high it is or how wide it spread   than he that can measure it and count all it bough and neither owns   it nor know or love it Creator so a believer whose all this world   of wealth is and who having nothing yet possesseth all thing by   cleaving unto Thee whom all thing serve though he know not even   the circle of the Great Bear yet is it folly to doubt but he is in a   better state than one who can measure the heaven and number the star   and poise the element yet neglecteth Thee who hast made all thing in   number weight and measure     But yet who bade that Manichaeus write on these thing also skill in   which wa no element of piety For Thou hast said to man Behold   piety and wisdom of which he might be ignorant though he had perfect   knowledge of these thing but these thing since knowing not he most   impudently dared to teach he plainly could have no knowledge of piety   For it is vanity to make profession of these worldly thing even when   known but confession to Thee is piety Wherefore this wanderer to this   end spake much of these thing that convicted by those who had truly   learned them it might be manifest what understanding he had in the   other abstruser thing For he would not have himself meanly thought of   but went about to persuade men That the Holy Ghost the Comforter and   Enricher of Thy faithful one wa with plenary authority personally   within him When then he wa found out to have taught falsely of the   heaven and star and of the motion of the sun and moon although these   thing pertain not to the doctrine of religion yet his sacrilegious   presumption would become evident enough seeing he delivered thing   which not only he knew not but which were falsified with so mad a   vanity of pride that he sought to ascribe them to himself a to a   divine person     For when I hear any Christian brother ignorant of these thing and   mistaken on them I can patiently behold such a man holding his opinion   nor do I see that any ignorance a to the position or character of the   corporeal creation can injure him so long a he doth not believe any   thing unworthy of Thee O Lord the Creator of all But it doth injure   him if he imagine it to pertain to the form of the doctrine of piety   and will yet affirm that too stiffly whereof he is ignorant And yet   is even such an infirmity in the infancy of faith borne by our mother   Charity till the newborn may grow up unto a perfect man so a not   to be carried about with every wind of doctrine But in him who in such   wise presumed to be the teacher source guide chief of all whom he   could so persuade that whoso followed him thought that he followed   not a mere man but Thy Holy Spirit who would not judge that so great   madness when once convicted of having taught any thing false were   to be detested and utterly rejected But I had not a yet clearly   ascertained whether the vicissitude of longer and shorter day and   night and of day and night itself with the eclipse of the greater   light and whatever else of the kind I had read of in other book   might be explained consistently with his saying so that if they by   any mean might it should still remain a question to me whether it   were so or no but I might on account of his reputed sanctity rest my   credence upon his authority     And for almost all those nine year wherein with unsettled mind I had   been their disciple I had longed but too intensely for the coming of   this Faustus For the rest of the sect whom by chance I had lighted   upon when unable to solve my objection about these thing still held   out to me the coming of this Faustus by conference with whom these   and greater difficulty if I had them were to be most readily and   abundantly cleared When then he came I found him a man of pleasing   discourse and who could speak fluently and in better term yet still   but the selfsame thing which they were wo nt to say But what availed   the utmost neatness of the cupbearer to my thirst for a more precious   draught Mine ear were already cloyed with the like nor did they seem   to me therefore better because better said nor therefore true because   eloquent nor the soul therefore wise because the face wa comely   and the language graceful But they who held him out to me were no good   judge of thing and therefore to them he appeared understanding and   wise because in word pleasing I felt however that another sort of   people were suspicious even of truth and refused to assent to it if   delivered in a smooth and copious discourse But Thou O my God hadst   already taught me by wonderful and secret way and therefore I believe   that Thou taughtest me because it is truth nor is there besides Thee   any teacher of truth where or whencesoever it may shine upon u Of   Thyself therefore had I now learned that neither ought any thing to   seem to be spoken truly because eloquently nor therefore falsely   because the utterance of the lip is inharmonious nor again therefore   true because rudely delivered nor therefore false because the   language is rich but that wisdom and folly are a wholesome and   unwholesome food and adorned or unadorned phrase a courtly or country   vessel either kind of meat may be served up in either kind of dish     That greediness then wherewith I had of so long time expected that man   wa delighted verily with his action and feeling when disputing and his   choice and readiness of word to clothe his idea I wa then delighted   and with many others and more than they did I praise and extol him   It troubled me however that in the assembly of his auditor I wa not   allowed to put in and communicate those question that troubled me   in familiar converse with him Which when I might and with my friend   began to engage his ear at such time a it wa not unbecoming for him   to discus with me and had brought forward such thing a moved me I   found him first utterly ignorant of liberal science save grammar and   that but in an ordinary way But because he had read some of Tullys   Orations a very few book of Seneca some thing of the poet and such   few volume of his own sect a were written in Latin and neatly and   wa daily practised in speaking he acquired a certain eloquence which   proved the more pleasing and seductive because under the guidance of a   good wit and with a kind of natural gracefulness Is it not thus a I   recall it O Lord my God Thou judge of my conscience before Thee is   my heart and my remembrance Who didst at that time direct me by the   hidden mystery of Thy providence and didst set those shameful error of   mine before my face that I might see and hate them     For after it wa clear that he wa ignorant of those art in which I   thought he excelled I began to despair of his opening and solving the   difficulty which perplexed me of which indeed however ignorant he   might have held the truth of piety had he not been a Manichee For   their book are fraught with prolix fable of the heaven and star   sun and moon and I now no longer thought him able satisfactorily to   decide what I much desired whether on comparison of these thing with   the calculation I had elsewhere read the account given in the book of   Manichaeus were preferable or at least a good Which when I proposed   to be considered and discussed he so far modestly shrunk from the   burthen For he knew that he knew not these thing and wa not ashamed   to confess it For he wa not one of those talking person many of whom   I had endured who undertook to teach me these thing and said nothing   But this man had a heart though not right towards Thee yet neither   altogether treacherous to himself For he wa not altogether ignorant of   his own ignorance nor would he rashly be entangled in a dispute whence   he could neither retreat nor extricate himself fairly Even for this I   liked him the better For fairer is the modesty of a candid mind than   the knowledge of those thing which I desired and such I found him in   all the more difficult and subtile question     My zeal for the writing of Manichaeus being thus blunted and   despairing yet more of their other teacher seeing that in diver   thing which perplexed me he so renowned among them had so turned   out I began to engage with him in the study of that literature on   which he also wa much set and which a rhetoricreader I wa at that   time teaching young student at Carthage and to read with him either   what himself desired to hear or such a I judged fit for his genius   But all my effort whereby I had purposed to advance in that sect   upon knowledge of that man came utterly to an end not that I detached   myself from them altogether but a one finding nothing better I had   settled to be content meanwhile with what I had in whatever way fallen   upon unless by chance something more eligible should dawn upon me   Thus that Faustus to so many a snare of death had now neither willing   nor witting it begun to loosen that wherein I wa taken For Thy hand   O my God in the secret purpose of Thy providence did not forsake my   soul and out of my mother heart blood through her tear night and   day poured out wa a sacrifice offered for me unto Thee and Thou didst   deal with me by wondrous way Thou didst it O my God for the step   of a man are ordered by the Lord and He shall dispose his way Or how   shall we obtain salvation but from Thy hand remaking what it made     Thou didst deal with me that I should be persuaded to go to Rome and   to teach there rather what I wa teaching at Carthage And how I wa   persuaded to this I will not neglect to confess to Thee because herein   also the deepest recess of Thy wisdom and Thy most present mercy to   u must be considered and confessed I did not wish therefore to go to   Rome because higher gain and higher dignity were warranted me by my   friend who persuaded me to this though even these thing had at that   time an influence over my mind but my chief and almost only reason   wa that I heard that young men studied there more peacefully and were   kept quiet under a restraint of more regular discipline so that they   did not at their pleasure petulantly rush into the school of   one whose pupil they were not nor were even admitted without his   permission Whereas at Carthage there reign among the scholar a most   disgraceful and unruly licence They burst in audaciously and   with gesture almost frantic disturb all order which any one hath   established for the good of his scholar Divers outrage they commit   with a wonderful stolidity punishable by law did not custom uphold   them that custom evincing them to be the more miserable in that they   now do a lawful what by Thy eternal law shall never be lawful and they   think they do it unpunished whereas they are punished with the very   blindness whereby they do it and suffer incomparably worse than what   they do The manner then which when a student I would not make my   own I wa fain a a teacher to endure in others and so I wa well   pleased to go where all that knew it assured me that the like wa not   done But Thou my refuge and my portion in the land of the living   that I might change my earthly dwelling for the salvation of my soul   at Carthage didst goad me that I might thereby be torn from it and at   Rome didst proffer me allurement whereby I might be drawn thither   by men in love with a dying life the one doing frantic the other   promising vain thing and to correct my step didst secretly use   their and my own perverseness For both they who disturbed my quiet were   blinded with a disgraceful frenzy and they who invited me elsewhere   savoured of earth And I who here detested real misery wa there   seeking unreal happiness     But why I went hence and went thither Thou knewest O God yet   showedst it neither to me nor to my mother who grievously bewailed my   journey and followed me a far a the sea But I deceived her holding   me by force that either she might keep me back or go with me and I   feigned that I had a friend whom I could not leave till he had a fair   wind to sail And I lied to my mother and such a mother and escaped   for this also hast Thou mercifully forgiven me preserving me thus full   of execrable defilement from the water of the sea for the water of   Thy Grace whereby when I wa cleansed the stream of my mother eye   should be dried with which for me she daily watered the ground under   her face And yet refusing to return without me I scarcely persuaded   her to stay that night in a place hard by our ship where wa an Oratory   in memory of the blessed Cyprian That night I privily departed but she   wa not behind in weeping and prayer And what O Lord wa she with so   many tear asking of Thee but that Thou wouldest not suffer me to sail   But Thou in the depth of Thy counsel and hearing the main point of her   desire regardest not what she then asked that Thou mightest make me   what she ever asked The wind blew and swelled our sail and withdrew   the shore from our sight and she on the morrow wa there frantic with   sorrow and with complaint and groan filled Thine ear Who didst then   disregard them whilst through my desire Thou wert hurrying me to end   all desire and the earthly part of her affection to me wa chastened   by the allotted scourge of sorrow For she loved my being with her a   mother do but much more than many and she knew not how great joy Thou   wert about to work for her out of my absence She knew not therefore   did she weep and wail and by this agony there appeared in her the   inheritance of Eve with sorrow seeking what in sorrow she had brought   forth And yet after accusing my treachery and hardheartedness she   betook herself again to intercede to Thee for me went to her wonted   place and I to Rome     And lo there wa I received by the scourge of bodily sickness and I   wa going down to hell carrying all the sin which I had committed   both against Thee and myself and others many and grievous over and   above that bond of original sin whereby we all die in Adam For   Thou hadst not forgiven me any of these thing in Christ nor had He   abolished by His Cross the enmity which by my sin I had incurred with   Thee For how should He by the crucifixion of a phantasm which I   believed Him to be So true then wa the death of my soul a that   of His flesh seemed to me false and how true the death of His body   so false wa the life of my soul which did not believe it And now the   fever heightening I wa parting and departing for ever For had I then   parted hence whither had I departed but into fire and torment such   a my misdeed deserved in the truth of Thy appointment And this she   knew not yet in absence prayed for me But Thou everywhere present   heardest her where she wa and where I wa hadst compassion upon me   that I should recover the health of my body though frenzied a yet   in my sacrilegious heart For I did not in all that danger desire Thy   baptism and I wa better a a boy when I begged it of my mother   piety a I have before recited and confessed But I had grown up to my   own shame and I madly scoffed at the prescript of Thy medicine who   wouldest not suffer me being such to die a double death With which   wound had my mother heart been pierced it could never be healed For   I can not express the affection she bore to me and with how much more   vehement anguish she wa now in labour of me in the spirit than at her   childbearing in the flesh     I see not then how she should have been healed had such a death of mine   stricken through the bowel of her love And where would have been those   her so strong and unceasing prayer unintermitting to Thee alone But   wouldest Thou God of mercy despise the contrite and humbled heart of   that chaste and sober widow so frequent in almsdeeds so full of duty   and service to Thy saint no day intermitting the oblation at Thine   altar twice a day morning and evening without any intermission   coming to Thy church not for idle tattlings and old wife fable but   that she might hear Thee in Thy discourse and Thou her in her prayer   Couldest Thou despise and reject from Thy aid the tear of such an one   wherewith she begged of Thee not gold or silver nor any mutable or   passing good but the salvation of her son soul Thou by whose gift   she wa such Never Lord Yea Thou wert at hand and wert hearing and   doing in that order wherein Thou hadst determined before that it should   be done Far be it that Thou shouldest deceive her in Thy vision and   answer some whereof I have some I have not mentioned which she laid   up in her faithful heart and ever praying urged upon Thee a   Thine own handwriting For Thou because Thy mercy endureth for ever   vouchsafest to those to whom Thou forgivest all of their debt to   become also a debtor by Thy promise     Thou recoveredst me then of that sickness and healedst the son of Thy   handmaid for the time in body that he might live for Thee to bestow   upon him a better and more abiding health And even then at Rome I   joined myself to those deceiving and deceived holy one not with   their disciple only of which number wa he in whose house I had   fallen sick and recovered but also with those whom they call The   Elect For I still thought that it wa not we that sin but that I   know not what other nature sinned in u and it delighted my pride to   be free from blame and when I had done any evil not to confess I had   done any that Thou mightest heal my soul because it had sinned against   Thee but I loved to excuse it and to accuse I know not what other   thing which wa with me but which I wa not But in truth it wa   wholly I and mine impiety had divided me against myself and that sin   wa the more incurable whereby I did not judge myself a sinner and   execrable iniquity it wa that I had rather have Thee Thee O God   Almighty to be overcome in me to my destruction than myself of Thee to   salvation Not a yet then hadst Thou set a watch before my mouth and a   door of safe keeping around my lip that my heart might not turn   aside to wicked speech to make excuse of sin with men that work   iniquity and therefore wa I still united with their Elect     But now despairing to make proficiency in that false doctrine even   those thing with which if I should find no better I had resolved to   rest contented I now held more laxly and carelessly For there half   arose a thought in me that those philosopher whom they call Academics   were wiser than the rest for that they held men ought to doubt   everything and laid down that no truth can be comprehended by man   for so not then understanding even their meaning I also wa clearly   convinced that they thought a they are commonly reported Yet did I   freely and openly discourage that host of mine from that overconfidence   which I perceived him to have in those fable which the book of   Manichaeus are full of Yet I lived in more familiar friendship with   them than with others who were not of this heresy Nor did I maintain   it with my ancient eagerness still my intimacy with that sect Rome   secretly harbouring many of them made me slower to seek any other way   especially since I despaired of finding the truth from which they had   turned me aside in Thy Church O Lord of heaven and earth Creator of   all thing visible and invisible and it seemed to me very unseemly to   believe Thee to have the shape of human flesh and to be bounded by the   bodily lineament of our member And because when I wished to think on   my God I knew not what to think of but a mass of body for what wa   not such did not seem to me to be anything this wa the greatest and   almost only cause of my inevitable error     For hence I believed Evil also to be some such kind of substance and   to have it own foul and hideous bulk whether gross which they called   earth or thin and subtile like the body of the air which they   imagine to be some malignant mind creeping through that earth And   because a piety such a it wa constrained me to believe that the good   God never created any evil nature I conceived two mass contrary   to one another both unbounded but the evil narrower the good more   expansive And from this pestilent beginning the other sacrilegious   conceit followed on me For when my mind endeavoured to recur to the   Catholic faith I wa driven back since that wa not the Catholic faith   which I thought to be so And I seemed to myself more reverential if I   believed of Thee my God to whom Thy mercy confess out of my mouth   a unbounded at least on other side although on that one where the   mass of evil wa opposed to Thee I wa constrained to confess Thee   bounded than if on all side I should imagine Thee to be bounded by the   form of a human body And it seemed to me better to believe Thee to have   created no evil which to me ignorant seemed not some only but a bodily   substance because I could not conceive of mind unless a a subtile   body and that diffused in definite space than to believe the nature   of evil such a I conceived it could come from Thee Yea and our   Saviour Himself Thy Only Begotten I believed to have been reached   forth a it were for our salvation out of the mass of Thy most lucid   substance so a to believe nothing of Him but what I could imagine in   my vanity His Nature then being such I thought could not be born   of the Virgin Mary without being mingled with the flesh and how that   which I had so figured to myself could be mingled and not defiled I   saw not I feared therefore to believe Him born in the flesh lest   I should be forced to believe Him defiled by the flesh Now will Thy   spiritual one mildly and lovingly smile upon me if they shall read   these my confession Yet such wa I     Furthermore what the Manichees had criticised in Thy Scriptures I   thought could not be defended yet at time verily I had a wish to   confer upon these several point with some one very well skilled in   those book and to make trial what he thought thereon for the word   of one Helpidius a he spoke and disputed face to face against the   said Manichees had begun to stir me even at Carthage in that he   had produced thing out of the Scriptures not easily withstood the   Manichees answer whereto seemed to me weak And this answer they   liked not to give publicly but only to u in private It wa that the   Scriptures of the New Testament had been corrupted by I know not whom   who wished to engraff the law of the Jews upon the Christian faith yet   themselves produced not any uncorrupted copy But I conceiving of   thing corporeal only wa mainly held down vehemently oppressed and   in a manner suffocated by those mass panting under which after the   breath of Thy truth I could not breathe it pure and untainted     I began then diligently to practise that for which I came to Rome to   teach rhetoric and first to gather some to my house to whom and   through whom I had begun to be known when lo I found other offence   committed in Rome to which I wa not exposed in Africa True those   subvertings by profligate young men were not here practised a wa   told me but on a sudden said they to avoid paying their   master stipend a number of youth plot together and remove to   anotherbreakers of faith who for love of money hold justice cheap   These also my heart hated though not with a perfect hatred for   perchance I hated them more because I wa to suffer by them than   because they did thing utterly unlawful Of a truth such are base   person and they go a whoring from Thee loving these fleeting   mockery of thing temporal and filthy lucre which foul the hand   that grasp it hugging the fleeting world and despising Thee Who   abidest and recallest and forgivest the adulteress soul of man when   she return to Thee And now I hate such depraved and crooked person   though I love them if corrigible so a to prefer to money the learning   which they acquire and to learning Thee O God the truth and fulness   of assured good and most pure peace But then I rather for my own sake   misliked them evil than liked and wished them good for Thine     When therefore they of Milan had sent to Rome to the prefect of the   city to furnish them with a rhetoric reader for their city and sent   him at the public expense I made application through those very   person intoxicated with Manichaean vanity to be freed wherefrom   I wa to go neither of u however knowing it that Symmachus then   prefect of the city would try me by setting me some subject and so   send me To Milan I came to Ambrose the Bishop known to the whole   world a among the best of men Thy devout servant whose eloquent   discourse did then plentifully dispense unto Thy people the flour of Thy   wheat the gladness of Thy oil and the sober inebriation of Thy wine   To him wa I unknowing led by Thee that by him I might knowingly be   led to Thee That man of God received me a a father and showed me an   Episcopal kindness on my coming Thenceforth I began to love him at   first indeed not a a teacher of the truth which I utterly despaired   of in Thy Church but a a person kind towards myself And I listened   diligently to him preaching to the people not with that intent I ought   but a it were trying his eloquence whether it answered the fame   thereof or flowed fuller or lower than wa reported and I hung on his   word attentively but of the matter I wa a a careless and scornful   lookeron and I wa delighted with the sweetness of his discourse   more recondite yet in manner le winning and harmonious than that of   Faustus Of the matter however there wa no comparison for the one   wa wandering amid Manichaean delusion the other teaching salvation   most soundly But salvation is far from sinner such a I then stood   before him and yet wa I drawing nearer by little and little and   unconsciously     For though I took no pain to learn what he spake but only to hear how   he spake for that empty care alone wa left me despairing of a way   open for man to Thee yet together with the word which I would   choose came also into my mind the thing which I would refuse for   I could not separate them And while I opened my heart to admit how   eloquently he spake there also entered how truly he spake but this   by degree For first these thing also had now begun to appear to   me capable of defence and the Catholic faith for which I had thought   nothing could be said against the Manichees objection I now thought   might be maintained without shamelessness especially after I had heard   one or two place of the Old Testament resolved and ofttimes in a   figure which when I understood literally I wa slain spiritually   Very many place then of those book having been explained I now blamed   my despair in believing that no answer could be given to such a hated   and scoffed at the Law and the Prophets Yet did I not therefore then   see that the Catholic way wa to be held because it also could find   learned maintainer who could at large and with some show of reason   answer objection nor that what I held wa therefore to be condemned   because both side could be maintained For the Catholic cause seemed to   me in such sort not vanquished a still not a yet to be victorious     Hereupon I earnestly bent my mind to see if in any way I could by any   certain proof convict the Manichees of falsehood Could I once have   conceived a spiritual substance all their stronghold had been beaten   down and cast utterly out of my mind but I could not Notwithstanding   concerning the frame of this world and the whole of nature which the   sens of the flesh can reach to a I more and more considered and   compared thing I judged the tenet of most of the philosopher to have   been much more probable So then after the manner of the Academics a   they are supposed doubting of every thing and wavering between all I   settled so far that the Manichees were to be abandoned judging that   even while doubting I might not continue in that sect to which I   already preferred some of the philosopher to which philosopher   notwithstanding for that they were without the saving Name of Christ   I utterly refused to commit the cure of my sick soul I determined   therefore so long to be a Catechumen in the Catholic Church to which   I had been commended by my parent till something certain should dawn   upon me whither I might steer my course           BOOK VI       O Thou my hope from my youth where wert Thou to me and whither wert   Thou gone Hadst not Thou created me and separated me from the beast   of the field and fowl of the air Thou hadst made me wiser yet did I   walk in darkness and in slippery place and sought Thee abroad out of   myself and found not the God of my heart and had come into the depth   of the sea and distrusted and despaired of ever finding truth My   mother had now come to me resolute through piety following me over sea   and land in all peril confiding in Thee For in peril of the sea she   comforted the very mariner by whom passenger unacquainted with the   deep use rather to be comforted when troubled assuring them of a safe   arrival because Thou hadst by a vision assured her thereof She found   me in grievous peril through despair of ever finding truth But when   I had discovered to her that I wa now no longer a Manichee though   not yet a Catholic Christian she wa not overjoyed a at something   unexpected although she wa now assured concerning that part of my   misery for which she bewailed me a one dead though to be reawakened   by Thee carrying me forth upon the bier of her thought that Thou   mightest say to the son of the widow Young man I say unto thee Arise   and he should revive and begin to speak and Thou shouldest deliver him   to his mother Her heart then wa shaken with no tumultuous exultation   when she heard that what she daily with tear desired of Thee wa   already in so great part realised in that though I had not yet   attained the truth I wa rescued from falsehood but a being assured   that Thou Who hadst promised the whole wouldest one day give the rest   most calmly and with a heart full of confidence she replied to me   She believed in Christ that before she departed this life she should   see me a Catholic believer Thus much to me But to Thee Fountain   of mercy poured she forth more copious prayer and tear that Thou   wouldest hasten Thy help and enlighten my darkness and she hastened   the more eagerly to the Church and hung upon the lip of Ambrose   praying for the fountain of that water which springeth up unto life   everlasting But that man she loved a an angel of God because she knew   that by him I had been brought for the present to that doubtful state of   faith I now wa in through which she anticipated most confidently that   I should pas from sickness unto health after the access a it were   of a sharper fit which physician call the crisis     When then my mother had once a she wa wo nt in Afric brought to the   Churches built in memory of the Saints certain cake and bread and   wine and wa forbidden by the doorkeeper so soon a she knew that the   Bishop had forbidden this she so piously and obediently embraced   his wish that I myself wondered how readily she censured her own   practice rather than discus his prohibition For winebibbing did not   lay siege to her spirit nor did love of wine provoke her to hatred of   the truth a it doth too many both men and woman who revolt at a   lesson of sobriety a men welldrunk at a draught mingled with   water But she when she had brought her basket with the accustomed   festivalfood to be but tasted by herself and then given away never   joined therewith more than one small cup of wine diluted according to   her own abstemious habit which for courtesy she would taste And if   there were many church of the departed saint that were to be honoured   in that manner she still carried round that same one cup to be   used every where and this though not only made very watery but   unpleasantly heated with carrying about she would distribute to those   about her by small sip for she sought there devotion not pleasure   So soon then a she found this custom to be forbidden by that famous   preacher and most pious prelate even to those that would use it   soberly lest so an occasion of excess might be given to the drunken   and for these a it were anniversary funeral solemnity did much   resemble the superstition of the Gentiles she most willingly forbare   it and for a basket filled with fruit of the earth she had learned to   bring to the Churches of the martyr a breast filled with more   purified petition and to give what she could to the poor that so   the communication of the Lords Body might be there rightly celebrated   where after the example of His Passion the martyr had been sacrificed   and crowned But yet it seems to me O Lord my God and thus think my   heart of it in Thy sight that perhaps she would not so readily have   yielded to the cutting off of this custom had it been forbidden by   another whom she loved not a Ambrose whom for my salvation   she loved most entirely and he her again for her most religious   conversation whereby in good work so fervent in spirit she wa   constant at church so that when he saw me he often burst forth into   her praise congratulating me that I had such a mother not knowing   what a son she had in me who doubted of all these thing and imagined   the way to life could not be found out     Nor did I yet groan in my prayer that Thou wouldest help me but   my spirit wa wholly intent on learning and restless to dispute And   Ambrose himself a the world count happy I esteemed a happy man whom   personage so great held in such honour only his celibacy seemed to me   a painful course But what hope he bore within him what struggle he   had against the temptation which beset his very excellency or what   comfort in adversity and what sweet joy Thy Bread had for the hidden   mouth of his spirit when chewing the cud thereof I neither could   conjecture nor had experienced Nor did he know the tide of my   feeling or the abyss of my danger For I could not ask of him what   I would a I would being shut out both from his ear and speech by   multitude of busy people whose weakness he served With whom when he   wa not taken up which wa but a little time he wa either refreshing   his body with the sustenance absolutely necessary or his mind with   reading But when he wa reading his eye glided over the page and   his heart searched out the sense but his voice and tongue were at rest   Ofttimes when we had come for no man wa forbidden to enter nor wa it   his wo nt that any who came should be announced to him we saw him thus   reading to himself and never otherwise and having long sat silent   for who durst intrude on one so intent we were fain to depart   conjecturing that in the small interval which he obtained free from the   din of others business for the recruiting of his mind he wa loth to   be taken off and perchance he dreaded lest if the author he read should   deliver any thing obscurely some attentive or perplexed hearer should   desire him to expound it or to discus some of the harder question so   that his time being thus spent he could not turn over so many volume   a he desired although the preserving of his voice which a very little   speaking would weaken might be the truer reason for his reading to   himself But with what intent soever he did it certainly in such a man   it wa good     I however certainly had no opportunity of enquiring what I wished of   that so holy oracle of Thine his breast unless the thing might be   answered briefly But those tide in me to be poured out to him   required his full leisure and never found it I heard him indeed every   Lords day rightly expounding the Word of truth among the people and   I wa more and more convinced that all the knot of those crafty   calumny which those our deceiver had knit against the Divine Books   could be unravelled But when I understood withal that man created   by Thee after Thine own image wa not so understood by Thy spiritual   son whom of the Catholic Mother Thou hast born again through grace   a though they believed and conceived of Thee a bounded by human shape   although what a spiritual substance should be I had not even a faint or   shadowy notion yet with joy I blushed at having so many year barked   not against the Catholic faith but against the fiction of carnal   imagination For so rash and impious had I been that what I ought by   enquiring to have learned I had pronounced on condemning For Thou   Most High and most near most secret and most present Who hast not   limb some larger some smaller but art wholly every where and no   where in space art not of such corporeal shape yet hast Thou made man   after Thine own image and behold from head to foot is he contained in   space     Ignorant then how this Thy image should subsist I should have knocked   and proposed the doubt how it wa to be believed not insultingly   opposed it a if believed Doubt then what to hold for certain   the more sharply gnawed my heart the more ashamed I wa that so long   deluded and deceived by the promise of certainty I had with childish   error and vehemence prated of so many uncertainty For that they were   falsehood became clear to me later However I wa certain that they   were uncertain and that I had formerly accounted them certain when   with a blind contentiousness I accused Thy Catholic Church whom I now   discovered not indeed a yet to teach truly but at least not to teach   that for which I had grievously censured her So I wa confounded and   converted and I joyed O my God that the One Only Church the body of   Thine Only Son wherein the name of Christ had been put upon me a an   infant had no taste for infantine conceit nor in her sound doctrine   maintained any tenet which should confine Thee the Creator of all in   space however great and large yet bounded every where by the limit of   a human form     I joyed also that the old Scriptures of the law and the Prophets were   laid before me not now to be perused with that eye to which before they   seemed absurd when I reviled Thy holy one for so thinking whereas   indeed they thought not so and with joy I heard Ambrose in his sermon   to the people oftentimes most diligently recommend this text for a   rule The letter killeth but the Spirit giveth life whilst he drew   aside the mystic veil laying open spiritually what according to the   letter seemed to teach something unsound teaching herein nothing that   offended me though he taught what I knew not a yet whether it were   true For I kept my heart from assenting to any thing fearing to fall   headlong but by hanging in suspense I wa the worse killed For I   wished to be a assured of the thing I saw not a I wa that seven and   three are ten For I wa not so mad a to think that even this could not   be comprehended but I desired to have other thing a clear a this   whether thing corporeal which were not present to my sens or   spiritual whereof I knew not how to conceive except corporeally And   by believing might I have been cured that so the eyesight of my soul   being cleared might in some way be directed to Thy truth which abideth   always and in no part faileth But a it happens that one who ha tried   a bad physician fear to trust himself with a good one so wa it with   the health of my soul which could not be healed but by believing and   lest it should believe falsehood refused to be cured resisting Thy   hand Who hast prepared the medicine of faith and hast applied   them to the disease of the whole world and given unto them so great   authority     Being led however from this to prefer the Catholic doctrine I felt   that her proceeding wa more unassuming and honest in that she required   to be believed thing not demonstrated whether it wa that they could   in themselves be demonstrated but not to certain person or could not   at all be whereas among the Manichees our credulity wa mocked by a   promise of certain knowledge and then so many most fabulous and   absurd thing were imposed to be believed because they could not be   demonstrated Then Thou O Lord little by little with most tender and   most merciful hand touching and composing my heart didst persuade   meconsidering what innumerable thing I believed which I saw not nor   wa present while they were done a so many thing in secular history   so many report of place and of city which I had not seen so many   of friend so many of physician so many continually of other men   which unless we should believe we should do nothing at all in this   life lastly with how unshaken an assurance I believed of what   parent I wa born which I could not know had I not believed upon   hearsayconsidering all this Thou didst persuade me that not they who   believed Thy Books which Thou hast established in so great authority   among almost all nation but they who believed them not were to be   blamed and that they were not to be heard who should say to me How   knowest thou those Scriptures to have been imparted unto mankind by the   Spirit of the one true and most true God For this very thing wa   of all most to be believed since no contentiousness of blasphemous   questioning of all that multitude which I had read in the   selfcontradicting philosopher could wring this belief from me   That Thou art whatsoever Thou wert what I knew not and That the   government of human thing belongs to Thee     This I believed sometimes more strongly more weakly otherwhiles yet I   ever believed both that Thou wert and hadst a care of u though I wa   ignorant both what wa to be thought of Thy substance and what way led   or led back to Thee Since then we were too weak by abstract reasoning   to find out truth and for this very cause needed the authority of Holy   Writ I had now begun to believe that Thou wouldest never have given   such excellency of authority to that Writ in all land hadst Thou not   willed thereby to be believed in thereby sought For now what thing   sounding strangely in the Scripture were wo nt to offend me having   heard diver of them expounded satisfactorily I referred to the depth   of the mystery and it authority appeared to me the more venerable   and more worthy of religious credence in that while it lay open to all   to read it reserved the majesty of it mystery within it profounder   meaning stooping to all in the great plainness of it word and   lowliness of it style yet calling forth the intensest application of   such a are not light of heart that so it might receive all in it open   bosom and through narrow passage waft over towards Thee some few yet   many more than if it stood not aloft on such a height of authority nor   drew multitude within it bosom by it holy lowliness These thing   I thought on and Thou wert with me I sighed and Thou heardest me I   wavered and Thou didst guide me I wandered through the broad way of   the world and Thou didst not forsake me     I panted after honour gain marriage and thou deridedst me In these   desire I underwent most bitter cross Thou being the more gracious   the le Thou sufferedst aught to grow sweet to me which wa not Thou   Behold my heart O Lord who wouldest I should remember all this and   confess to Thee Let my soul cleave unto Thee now that Thou hast freed   it from that fastholding birdlime of death How wretched wa it and   Thou didst irritate the feeling of it wound that forsaking all else   it might be converted unto Thee who art above all and without whom all   thing would be nothing be converted and be healed How miserable wa   I then and how didst Thou deal with me to make me feel my misery on   that day when I wa preparing to recite a panegyric of the Emperor   wherein I wa to utter many a lie and lying wa to be applauded by   those who knew I lied and my heart wa panting with these anxiety   and boiling with the feverishness of consuming thought For passing   through one of the street of Milan I observed a poor beggar then I   suppose with a full belly joking and joyous and I sighed and spoke   to the friend around me of the many sorrow of our frenzy for that   by all such effort of ours a those wherein I then toiled dragging   along under the goading of desire the burthen of my own wretchedness   and by dragging augmenting it we yet looked to arrive only at that   very joyousness whither that beggarman had arrived before u who   should never perchance attain it For what he had obtained by mean of a   few begged penny the same wa I plotting for by many a toilsome turning   and winding the joy of a temporary felicity For he verily had not the   true joy but yet I with those my ambitious design wa seeking one much   le true And certainly he wa joyous I anxious he void of care I   full of fear But should any ask me had I rather be merry or fearful   I would answer merry Again if he asked had I rather be such a he wa   or what I then wa I should choose to be myself though worn with care   and fear but out of wrong judgment for wa it the truth For I ought   not to prefer myself to him because more learned than he seeing I   had no joy therein but sought to please men by it and that not to   instruct but simply to please Wherefore also Thou didst break my bone   with the staff of Thy correction     Away with those then from my soul who say to her It make a difference   whence a man joy is That beggarman joyed in drunkenness Thou   desiredst to joy in glory What glory Lord That which is not in   Thee For even a his wa no true joy so wa that no true glory and   it overthrew my soul more He that very night should digest his   drunkenness but I had slept and risen again with mine and wa to sleep   again and again to rise with it how many day Thou God knowest But   it doth make a difference whence a man joy is I know it and the   joy of a faithful hope lieth incomparably beyond such vanity Yea and   so wa he then beyond me for he verily wa the happier not only for   that he wa thoroughly drenched in mirth I disembowelled with care   but he by fair wish had gotten wine I by lying wa seeking for   empty swelling praise Much to this purpose said I then to my friend   and I often marked in them how it fared with me and I found it went ill   with me and grieved and doubled that very ill and if any prosperity   smiled on me I wa loth to catch at it for almost before I could grasp   it it flew away     These thing we who were living a friend together bemoaned together   but chiefly and most familiarly did I speak thereof with Alypius and   Nebridius of whom Alypius wa born in the same town with me of person   of chief rank there but younger than I For he had studied under me   both when I first lectured in our town and afterwards at Carthage and   he loved me much because I seemed to him kind and learned and I him   for his great towardliness to virtue which wa eminent enough in one of   no greater year Yet the whirlpool of Carthaginian habit amongst whom   those idle spectacle are hotly followed had drawn him into the   madness of the Circus But while he wa miserably tossed therein and   I professing rhetoric there had a public school a yet he used not my   teaching by reason of some unkindness risen betwixt his father and me   I had found then how deadly he doted upon the Circus and wa deeply   grieved that he seemed likely nay or had thrown away so great promise   yet had I no mean of advising or with a sort of constraint reclaiming   him either by the kindness of a friend or the authority of a master   For I supposed that he thought of me a did his father but he wa not   such laying aside then his father mind in that matter he began to   greet me come sometimes into my lecture room hear a little and be   gone     I however had forgotten to deal with him that he should not through   a blind and headlong desire of vain pastime undo so good a wit But   Thou O Lord who guidest the course of all Thou hast created hadst   not forgotten him who wa one day to be among Thy child Priest   and Dispenser of Thy Sacrament and that his amendment might plainly be   attributed to Thyself Thou effectedst it through me unknowingly For   a one day I sat in my accustomed place with my scholar before me   he entered greeted me sat down and applied his mind to what I   then handled I had by chance a passage in hand which while I wa   explaining a likeness from the Circensian race occurred to me a   likely to make what I would convey pleasanter and plainer seasoned   with biting mockery of those whom that madness had enthralled God Thou   knowest that I then thought not of curing Alypius of that infection But   he took it wholly to himself and thought that I said it simply for his   sake And whence another would have taken occasion of offence with me   that rightminded youth took a a ground of being offended at himself   and loving me more fervently For Thou hadst said it long ago and put   it into Thy book Rebuke a wise man and he will love Thee But I had   not rebuked him but Thou who employest all knowing or not knowing in   that order which Thyself knowest and that order is just didst of my   heart and tongue make burning coal by which to set on fire the   hopeful mind thus languishing and so cure it Let him be silent in Thy   praise who considers not Thy mercy which confess unto Thee out of   my inmost soul For he upon that speech burst out of that pit so deep   wherein he wa wilfully plunged and wa blinded with it wretched   pastime and he shook his mind with a strong selfcommand whereupon   all the filth of the Circensian pastime flew off from him nor came he   again thither Upon this he prevailed with his unwilling father that he   might be my scholar He gave way and gave in And Alypius beginning   to be my hearer again wa involved in the same superstition with me   loving in the Manichees that show of continency which he supposed true   and unfeigned Whereas it wa a senseless and seducing continency   ensnaring precious soul unable a yet to reach the depth of virtue   yet readily beguiled with the surface of what wa but a shadowy and   counterfeit virtue     He not forsaking that secular course which his parent had charmed him   to pursue had gone before me to Rome to study law and there he wa   carried away incredibly with an incredible eagerness after the show of   gladiator For being utterly averse to and detesting spectacle he wa   one day by chance met by diver of his acquaintance and fellowstudents   coming from dinner and they with a familiar violence haled him   vehemently refusing and resisting into the Amphitheatre during these   cruel and deadly show he thus protesting Though you hale my body to   that place and there set me can you force me also to turn my mind or   my eye to those show I shall then be absent while present and   so shall overcome both you and them They hearing this led him on   nevertheless desirous perchance to try that very thing whether he   could do a he said When they were come thither and had taken their   place a they could the whole place kindled with that savage pastime   But he closing the passage of his eye forbade his mind to range   abroad after such evil and would he had stopped his ear also For in   the fight when one fell a mighty cry of the whole people striking him   strongly overcome by curiosity and a if prepared to despise and be   superior to it whatsoever it were even when seen he opened his eye   and wa stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other whom he   desired to behold wa in his body and he fell more miserably than he   upon whose fall that mighty noise wa raised which entered through his   ear and unlocked his eye to make way for the striking and beating   down of a soul bold rather than resolute and the weaker in that it   had presumed on itself which ought to have relied on Thee For so soon   a he saw that blood he therewith drunk down savageness nor turned   away but fixed his eye drinking in frenzy unawares and wa delighted   with that guilty fight and intoxicated with the bloody pastime Nor wa   he now the man he came but one of the throng he came unto yea a true   associate of theirs that brought him thither Why say more He beheld   shouted kindled carried thence with him the madness which should goad   him to return not only with them who first drew him thither but also   before them yea and to draw in others Yet thence didst Thou with a   most strong and most merciful hand pluck him and taughtest him to have   confidence not in himself but in Thee But this wa after     But this wa already being laid up in his memory to be a medicine   hereafter So wa that also that when he wa yet studying under me at   Carthage and wa thinking over at midday in the marketplace what he   wa to say by heart a scholar use to practise Thou sufferedst him   to be apprehended by the officer of the marketplace for a thief For   no other cause I deem didst Thou our God suffer it but that he who   wa hereafter to prove so great a man should already begin to learn   that in judging of cause man wa not readily to be condemned by man   out of a rash credulity For a he wa walking up and down by himself   before the judgmentseat with his notebook and pen lo a young man a   lawyer the real thief privily bringing a hatchet got in unperceived   by Alypius a far a the leaden grating which fence in the   silversmith shop and began to cut away the lead But the noise of   the hatchet being heard the silversmith beneath began to make a stir   and sent to apprehend whomever they should find But he hearing their   voice ran away leaving his hatchet fearing to be taken with it   Alypius now who had not seen him enter wa aware of his going and   saw with what speed he made away And being desirous to know the matter   entered the place where finding the hatchet he wa standing wondering   and considering it when behold those that had been sent find him   alone with the hatchet in his hand the noise whereof had startled and   brought them thither They seize him hale him away and gathering the   dweller in the marketplace together boast of having taken a notorious   thief and so he wa being led away to be taken before the judge     But thus far wa Alypius to be instructed For forthwith O Lord Thou   succouredst his innocency whereof Thou alone wert witness For a he   wa being led either to prison or to punishment a certain architect met   them who had the chief charge of the public building Glad they   were to meet him especially by whom they were wo nt to be suspected of   stealing the good lost out of the marketplace a though to show him at   last by whom these theft were committed He however had diver time   seen Alypius at a certain senator house to whom he often went to pay   his respect and recognising him immediately took him aside by the   hand and enquiring the occasion of so great a calamity heard the whole   matter and bade all present amid much uproar and threat to go with   him So they came to the house of the young man who had done the   deed There before the door wa a boy so young a to be likely not   apprehending any harm to his master to disclose the whole For he   had attended his master to the marketplace Whom so soon a Alypius   remembered he told the architect and he showing the hatchet to the   boy asked him Whose that wa Ours quoth he presently and being   further questioned he discovered every thing Thus the crime being   transferred to that house and the multitude ashamed which had begun   to insult over Alypius he who wa to be a dispenser of Thy Word and an   examiner of many cause in Thy Church went away better experienced and   instructed     Him then I had found at Rome and he clave to me by a most strong tie   and went with me to Milan both that he might not leave me and might   practise something of the law he had studied more to please his parent   than himself There he had thrice sat a Assessor with an uncorruptness   much wondered at by others he wondering at others rather who could   prefer gold to honesty His character wa tried besides not only with   the bait of covetousness but with the goad of fear At Rome he wa   Assessor to the count of the Italian Treasury There wa at that time a   very powerful senator to whose favour many stood indebted many much   feared He would need by his usual power have a thing allowed him   which by the law wa unallowed Alypius resisted it a bribe wa   promised with all his heart he scorned it threat were held out he   trampled upon them all wondering at so unwonted a spirit which neither   desired the friendship nor feared the enmity of one so great and so   mightily renowned for innumerable mean of doing good or evil And the   very judge whose councillor Alypius wa although also unwilling   it should be yet did not openly refuse but put the matter off upon   Alypius alleging that he would not allow him to do it for in truth had   the judge done it Alypius would have decided otherwise With this one   thing in the way of learning wa he wellnigh seduced that he might   have book copied for him at Praetorian price but consulting justice   he altered his deliberation for the better esteeming equity whereby he   wa hindered more gainful than the power whereby he were allowed These   are slight thing but he that is faithful in little is faithful also   in much Nor can that any how be void which proceeded out of the mouth   of Thy Truth If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon   who will commit to your trust true rich And if ye have not been   faithful in that which is another man who shall give you that which   is your own He being such did at that time cleave to me and with me   wavered in purpose what course of life wa to be taken     Nebridius also who having left his native country near Carthage yea   and Carthage itself where he had much lived leaving his excellent   familyestate and house and a mother behind who wa not to follow him   had come to Milan for no other reason but that with me he might live in   a most ardent search after truth and wisdom Like me he sighed like   me he wavered an ardent searcher after true life and a most acute   examiner of the most difficult question Thus were there the mouth   of three indigent person sighing out their want one to another and   waiting upon Thee that Thou mightest give them their meat in due season   And in all the bitterness which by Thy mercy followed our worldly   affair a we looked towards the end why we should suffer all this   darkness met u and we turned away groaning and saying How long shall   these thing be This too we often said and so saying forsook them not   for a yet there dawned nothing certain which these forsaken we might   embrace     And I viewing and reviewing thing most wondered at the length of time   from that my nineteenth year wherein I had begun to kindle with the   desire of wisdom settling when I had found her to abandon all the   empty hope and lying frenzy of vain desire And lo I wa now in   my thirtieth year sticking in the same mire greedy of enjoying thing   present which passed away and wasted my soul while I said to myself   Tomorrow I shall find it it will appear manifestly and I shall grasp   it lo Faustus the Manichee will come and clear every thing O you   great men ye Academicians it is true then that no certainty can   be attained for the ordering of life Nay let u search the more   diligently and despair not Lo thing in the ecclesiastical book   are not absurd to u now which sometimes seemed absurd and may be   otherwise taken and in a good sense I will take my stand where a   a child my parent placed me until the clear truth be found out But   where shall it be sought or when Ambrose ha no leisure we have no   leisure to read where shall we find even the book Whence or when   procure them from whom borrow them Let set time be appointed and   certain hour be ordered for the health of our soul Great hope ha   dawned the Catholic Faith teach not what we thought and vainly   accused it of her instructed member hold it profane to believe God to   be bounded by the figure of a human body and do we doubt to knock   that the rest may be opened The forenoon our scholar take up what   do we during the rest Why not this But when then pay we court to our   great friend whose favour we need When compose what we may sell   to scholar When refresh ourselves unbending our mind from this   intenseness of care     Perish every thing dismiss we these empty vanity and betake   ourselves to the one search for truth Life is vain death uncertain if   it steal upon u on a sudden in what state shall we depart hence   and where shall we learn what here we have neglected and shall we not   rather suffer the punishment of this negligence What if death itself   cut off and end all care and feeling Then must this be ascertained   But God forbid this It is no vain and empty thing that the excellent   dignity of the authority of the Christian Faith hath overspread the   whole world Never would such and so great thing be by God wrought for   u if with the death of the body the life of the soul came to an end   Wherefore delay then to abandon worldly hope and give ourselves wholly   to seek after God and the blessed life But wait Even those thing are   pleasant they have some and no small sweetness We must not lightly   abandon them for it were a shame to return again to them See it is   no great matter now to obtain some station and then what should we more   wish for We have store of powerful friend if nothing else offer and   we be in much haste at least a presidentship may be given u and a   wife with some money that she increase not our charge and this shall   be the bound of desire Many great men and most worthy of imitation   have given themselves to the study of wisdom in the state of marriage     While I went over these thing and these wind shifted and drove my   heart this way and that time passed on but I delayed to turn to the   Lord and from day to day deferred to live in Thee and deferred not   daily to die in myself Loving a happy life I feared it in it own   abode and sought it by fleeing from it I thought I should be too   miserable unless folded in female arm and of the medicine of Thy   mercy to cure that infirmity I thought not not having tried it As for   continency I supposed it to be in our own power though in myself I did   not find that power being so foolish a not to know what is written   None can be continent unless Thou give it and that Thou wouldest give   it if with inward groanings I did knock at Thine ear and with a   settled faith did cast my care on Thee     Alypius indeed kept me from marrying alleging that so could we by no   mean with undistracted leisure live together in the love of wisdom a   we had long desired For himself wa even then most pure in this point   so that it wa wonderful and that the more since in the outset of his   youth he had entered into that course but had not stuck fast therein   rather had he felt remorse and revolting at it living thenceforth until   now most continently But I opposed him with the example of those who   a married men had cherished wisdom and served God acceptably and   retained their friend and loved them faithfully Of whose greatness of   spirit I wa far short and bound with the disease of the flesh and it   deadly sweetness drew along my chain dreading to be loosed and a if   my wound had been fretted put back his good persuasion a it were the   hand of one that would unchain me Moreover by me did the serpent   speak unto Alypius himself by my tongue weaving and laying in his   path pleasurable snare wherein his virtuous and free foot might be   entangled     For when he wondered that I whom he esteemed not slightly should stick   so fast in the birdlime of that pleasure a to protest so oft a we   discussed it that I could never lead a single life and urged in my   defence when I saw him wonder that there wa great difference between   his momentary and scarceremembered knowledge of that life which so   he might easily despise and my continued acquaintance whereto if the   honourable name of marriage were added he ought not to wonder why I   could not contemn that course he began also to desire to be married   not a overcome with desire of such pleasure but out of curiosity For   he would fain know he said what that should be without which my life   to him so pleasing would to me seem not life but a punishment For his   mind free from that chain wa amazed at my thraldom and through that   amazement wa going on to a desire of trying it thence to the trial   itself and thence perhaps to sink into that bondage whereat he   wondered seeing he wa willing to make a covenant with death and he   that love danger shall fall into it For whatever honour there be in   the office of wellordering a married life and a family moved u but   slightly But me for the most part the habit of satisfying an insatiable   appetite tormented while it held me captive him an admiring wonder   wa leading captive So were we until Thou O Most High not forsaking   our dust commiserating u miserable didst come to our help by   wondrous and secret way     Continual effort wa made to have me married I wooed I wa   promised chiefly through my mother pain that so once married the   healthgiving baptism might cleanse me towards which she rejoiced   that I wa being daily fitted and observed that her prayer and Thy   promise were being fulfilled in my faith At which time verily both   at my request and her own longing with strong cry of heart she   daily begged of Thee that Thou wouldest by a vision discover unto her   something concerning my future marriage Thou never wouldest She saw   indeed certain vain and fantastic thing such a the energy of the   human spirit busied thereon brought together and these she told me   of not with that confidence she wa wo nt when Thou showedst her any   thing but slighting them For she could she said through a certain   feeling which in word she could not express discern betwixt Thy   revelation and the dream of her own soul Yet the matter wa pressed   on and a maiden asked in marriage two year under the fit age and a   pleasing wa waited for     And many of u friend conferring about and detesting the turbulent   turmoil of human life had debated and now almost resolved on living   apart from business and the bustle of men and this wa to be thus   obtained we were to bring whatever we might severally procure and   make one household of all so that through the truth of our friendship   nothing should belong especially to any but the whole thus derived from   all should a a whole belong to each and all to all We thought there   might be some often person in this society some of whom were very   rich especially Romanianus our townsman from childhood a very familiar   friend of mine whom the grievous perplexity of his affair had   brought up to court who wa the most earnest for this project and   therein wa his voice of great weight because his ample estate far   exceeded any of the rest We had settled also that two annual officer   a it were should provide all thing necessary the rest being   undisturbed But when we began to consider whether the wife which   some of u already had others hoped to have would allow this all that   plan which wa being so well moulded fell to piece in our hand wa   utterly dashed and cast aside Thence we betook u to sigh and groan   and our step to follow the broad and beaten way of the world for many   thought were in our heart but Thy counsel standeth for ever Out   of which counsel Thou didst deride ours and preparedst Thine own   purposing to give u meat in due season and to fill our soul with   blessing     Meanwhile my sin were being multiplied and my concubine being torn   from my side a a hindrance to my marriage my heart which clave unto   her wa torn and wounded and bleeding And she returned to Afric vowing   unto Thee never to know any other man leaving with me my son by her   But unhappy I who could not imitate a very woman impatient of delay   inasmuch a not till after two year wa I to obtain her I sought not   being so much a lover of marriage a a slave to lust procured another   though no wife that so by the servitude of an enduring custom the   disease of my soul might be kept up and carried on in it vigour or   even augmented into the dominion of marriage Nor wa that my wound   cured which had been made by the cutting away of the former but after   inflammation and most acute pain it mortified and my pain became le   acute but more desperate     To Thee be praise glory to Thee Fountain of mercy I wa becoming   more miserable and Thou nearer Thy right hand wa continually ready to   pluck me out of the mire and to wash me thoroughly and I knew it   not nor did anything call me back from a yet deeper gulf of carnal   pleasure but the fear of death and of Thy judgment to come which   amid all my change never departed from my breast And in my dispute   with my friend Alypius and Nebridius of the nature of good and evil I   held that Epicurus had in my mind won the palm had I not believed that   after death there remained a life for the soul and place of requital   according to men desert which Epicurus would not believe And I   asked were we immortal and to live in perpetual bodily pleasure   without fear of losing it why should we not be happy or what else   should we seek not knowing that great misery wa involved in this very   thing that being thus sunk and blinded I could not discern that light   of excellence and beauty to be embraced for it own sake which the eye   of flesh can not see and is seen by the inner man Nor did I unhappy   consider from what source it sprung that even on these thing foul a   they were I with pleasure discoursed with my friend nor could I   even according to the notion I then had of happiness be happy without   friend amid what abundance soever of carnal pleasure And yet these   friend I loved for themselves only and I felt that I wa beloved of   them again for myself only     O crooked path Woe to the audacious soul which hoped by forsaking   Thee to gain some better thing Turned it hath and turned again upon   back side and belly yet all wa painful and Thou alone rest   And behold Thou art at hand and deliverest u from our wretched   wandering and placest u in Thy way and dost comfort u and say   Run I will carry you yea I will bring you through there also will I   carry you           BOOK VII       Deceased wa now that my evil and abominable youth and I wa passing   into early manhood the more defiled by vain thing a I grew in year   who could not imagine any substance but such a is wo nt to be seen with   these eye I thought not of Thee O God under the figure of a human   body since I began to hear aught of wisdom I always avoided this and   rejoiced to have found the same in the faith of our spiritual mother   Thy Catholic Church But what else to conceive of Thee I knew not And   I a man and such a man sought to conceive of Thee the sovereign   only true God and I did in my inmost soul believe that Thou wert   incorruptible and uninjurable and unchangeable because though not   knowing whence or how yet I saw plainly and wa sure that that which   may be corrupted must be inferior to that which can not what could not   be injured I preferred unhesitatingly to what could receive injury the   unchangeable to thing subject to change My heart passionately cried   out against all my phantom and with this one blow I sought to beat   away from the eye of my mind all that unclean troop which buzzed around   it And lo being scarce put off in the twinkling of an eye they   gathered again thick about me flew against my face and beclouded   it so that though not under the form of the human body yet wa I   constrained to conceive of Thee that incorruptible uninjurable and   unchangeable which I preferred before the corruptible and injurable   and changeable a being in space whether infused into the world or   diffused infinitely without it Because whatsoever I conceived deprived   of this space seemed to me nothing yea altogether nothing not even   a void a if a body were taken out of it place and the place should   remain empty of any body at all of earth and water air and heaven yet   would it remain a void place a it were a spacious nothing     I then being thus grosshearted nor clear even to myself whatsoever   wa not extended over certain space nor diffused nor condensed nor   swelled out or did not or could not receive some of these dimension   I thought to be altogether nothing For over such form a my eye are   wo nt to range did my heart then range nor yet did I see that this same   notion of the mind whereby I formed those very image wa not of this   sort and yet it could not have formed them had not itself been some   great thing So also did I endeavour to conceive of Thee Life of my   life a vast through infinite space on every side penetrating   the whole mass of the universe and beyond it every way through   unmeasurable boundless space so that the earth should have Thee the   heaven have Thee all thing have Thee and they be bounded in Thee and   Thou bounded nowhere For that a the body of this air which is above   the earth hindereth not the light of the sun from passing through it   penetrating it not by bursting or by cutting but by filling it wholly   so I thought the body not of heaven air and sea only but of the earth   too pervious to Thee so that in all it part the greatest a the   smallest it should admit Thy presence by a secret inspiration within   and without directing all thing which Thou hast created So I guessed   only a unable to conceive aught else for it wa false For thus should   a greater part of the earth contain a greater portion of Thee and a   le a lesser and all thing should in such sort be full of Thee   that the body of an elephant should contain more of Thee than that of   a sparrow by how much larger it is and take up more room and thus   shouldest Thou make the several portion of Thyself present unto the   several portion of the world in fragment large to the large   petty to the petty But such art not Thou But not a yet hadst Thou   enlightened my darkness     It wa enough for me Lord to oppose to those deceived deceiver and   dumb prater since Thy word sounded not out of themthat wa enough   which long ago while we were yet at Carthage Nebridius used to   propound at which all we that heard it were staggered That said   nation of darkness which the Manichees are wo nt to set a an opposing   mass over against Thee what could it have done unto Thee hadst Thou   refused to fight with it For if they answered it would have   done Thee some hurt then shouldest Thou be subject to injury and   corruption but it could do Thee no hurt then wa no reason brought   for Thy fighting with it and fighting in such wise a that a certain   portion or member of Thee or offspring of Thy very Substance should be   mingled with opposed power and nature not created by Thee and be   by them so far corrupted and changed to the worse a to be turned   from happiness into misery and need assistance whereby it might be   extricated and purified and that this offspring of Thy Substance wa   the soul which being enthralled defiled corrupted Thy Word free   pure and whole might relieve that Word itself being still corruptible   because it wa of one and the same Substance So then should they   affirm Thee whatsoever Thou art that is Thy Substance whereby   Thou art to be incorruptible then were all these saying false and   execrable but if corruptible the very statement showed it to be false   and revolting This argument then of Nebridius sufficed against those   who deserved wholly to be vomited out of the overcharged stomach for   they had no escape without horrible blasphemy of heart and tongue thus   thinking and speaking of Thee     But I also a yet although I held and wa firmly persuaded that Thou   our Lord the true God who madest not only our soul but our body   and not only our soul and body but all being and all thing wert   undefilable and unalterable and in no degree mutable yet understood I   not clearly and without difficulty the cause of evil And yet whatever   it were I perceived it wa in such wise to be sought out a should not   constrain me to believe the immutable God to be mutable lest I should   become that evil I wa seeking out I sought it out then thus far free   from anxiety certain of the untruth of what these held from whom I   shrunk with my whole heart for I saw that through enquiring the origin   of evil they were filled with evil in that they preferred to think   that Thy substance did suffer ill than their own did commit it     And I strained to perceive what I now heard that freewill wa the   cause of our doing ill and Thy just judgment of our suffering ill But   I wa not able clearly to discern it So then endeavouring to draw my   soul vision out of that deep pit I wa again plunged therein and   endeavouring often I wa plunged back a often But this raised me a   little into Thy light that I knew a well that I had a will a that I   lived when then I did will or nill any thing I wa most sure that no   other than myself did will and nill and I all but saw that there   wa the cause of my sin But what I did against my will I saw that   I suffered rather than did and I judged not to be my fault but my   punishment whereby however holding Thee to be just I speedily   confessed myself to be not unjustly punished But again I said Who made   me Did not my God Who is not only good but goodness itself Whence   then came I to will evil and nill good so that I am thus justly   punished who set this in me and ingrafted into me this plant of   bitterness seeing I wa wholly formed by my most sweet God If the   devil were the author whence is that same devil And if he also by his   own perverse will of a good angel became a devil whence again came   in him that evil will whereby he became a devil seeing the whole nature   of angel wa made by that most good Creator By these thought I wa   again sunk down and choked yet not brought down to that hell of error   where no man confesseth unto Thee to think rather that Thou dost   suffer ill than that man doth it     For I wa in such wise striving to find out the rest a one who had   already found that the incorruptible must need be better than the   corruptible and Thee therefore whatsoever Thou wert I confessed to   be incorruptible For never soul wa nor shall be able to conceive any   thing which may be better than Thou who art the sovereign and the   best good But since most truly and certainly the incorruptible is   preferable to the corruptible a I did now prefer it then wert Thou   not incorruptible I could in thought have arrived at something better   than my God Where then I saw the incorruptible to be preferable to the   corruptible there ought I to seek for Thee and there observe wherein   evil itself wa that is whence corruption come by which Thy   substance can by no mean be impaired For corruption doe no way   impair our God by no will by no necessity by no unlookedfor chance   because He is God and what He will is good and Himself is that   good but to be corrupted is not good Nor art Thou against Thy will   constrained to any thing since Thy will is not greater than Thy power   But greater should it be were Thyself greater than Thyself For the   will and power of God is God Himself And what can be unlookedfor by   Thee Who knowest all thing Nor is there any nature in thing but   Thou knowest it And what should we more say why that substance which   God is should not be corruptible seeing if it were so it should not   be God     And I sought whence is evil and sought in an evil way and saw not   the evil in my very search I set now before the sight of my spirit   the whole creation whatsoever we can see therein a sea earth air   star tree mortal creature yea and whatever in it we do not see   a the firmament of heaven all angel moreover and all the spiritual   inhabitant thereof But these very being a though they were   body did my fancy dispose in place and I made one great mass of Thy   creation distinguished a to the kind of body some real body   some what myself had feigned for spirit And this mass I made huge   not a it wa which I could not know but a I thought convenient yet   every way finite But Thee O Lord I imagined on every part environing   and penetrating it though every way infinite a if there were a sea   every where and on every side through unmeasured space one only   boundless sea and it contained within it some sponge huge but   bounded that sponge must need in all it part be filled from that   unmeasurable sea so conceived I Thy creation itself finite full of   Thee the Infinite and I said Behold God and behold what God hath   created and God is good yea most mightily and incomparably better   than all these but yet He the Good created them good and see how   He environeth and fulfils them Where is evil then and whence and how   crept it in hither What is it root and what it seed Or hath it no   being Why then fear we and avoid what is not Or if we fear it idly   then is that very fear evil whereby the soul is thus idly goaded and   racked Yea and so much a greater evil a we have nothing to fear and   yet do fear Therefore either is that evil which we fear or else evil   is that we fear Whence is it then seeing God the Good hath created   all these thing good He indeed the greater and chiefest Good hath   created these lesser good still both Creator and created all are   good Whence is evil Or wa there some evil matter of which He made   and formed and ordered it yet left something in it which He did not   convert into good Why so then Had He no might to turn and change the   whole so that no evil should remain in it seeing He is Allmighty   Lastly why would He make any thing at all of it and not rather by   the same Allmightiness cause it not to be at all Or could it then be   against His will Or if it were from eternity why suffered He it so to   be for infinite space of time past and wa pleased so long after to   make something out of it Or if He were suddenly pleased now to effect   somewhat this rather should the Allmighty have effected that this   evil matter should not be and He alone be the whole true sovereign   and infinite Good Or if it wa not good that He who wa good should not   also frame and create something that were good then that evil matter   being taken away and brought to nothing He might form good matter   whereof to create all thing For He should not be Allmighty if He   might not create something good without the aid of that matter which   Himself had not created These thought I revolved in my miserable   heart overcharged with most gnawing care lest I should die ere I had   found the truth yet wa the faith of Thy Christ our Lord and Saviour   professed in the Church Catholic firmly fixed in my heart in many   point indeed a yet unformed and fluctuating from the rule of   doctrine yet did not my mind utterly leave it but rather daily took in   more and more of it     By this time also had I rejected the lying divination and impious   dotage of the astrologer Let Thine own mercy out of my very   inmost soul confess unto Thee for this also O my God For Thou Thou   altogether for who else call u back from the death of all error   save the Life which can not die and the Wisdom which needing no light   enlightens the mind that need it whereby the universe is directed   down to the whirling leaf of treesThou madest provision for my   obstinacy wherewith I struggled against Vindicianus an acute old man   and Nebridius a young man of admirable talent the first vehemently   affirming and the latter often though with some doubtfulness saying   That there wa no such art whereby to foresee thing to come but that   men conjecture were a sort of lottery and that out of many thing   which they said should come to pas some actually did unawares to them   who spake it who stumbled upon it through their oft speaking   Thou providedst then a friend for me no negligent consulter of the   astrologer nor yet well skilled in those art but a I said a   curious consulter with them and yet knowing something which he said   he had heard of his father which how far it went to overthrow the   estimation of that art he knew not This man then Firminus by name   having had a liberal education and well taught in Rhetoric consulted   me a one very dear to him what according to his socalled   constellation I thought on certain affair of his wherein his worldly   hope had risen and I who had herein now begun to incline towards   Nebridius opinion did not altogether refuse to conjecture and tell   him what came into my unresolved mind but added that I wa now almost   persuaded that these were but empty and ridiculous folly Thereupon he   told me that his father had been very curious in such book and had   a friend a earnest in them a himself who with joint study and   conference fanned the flame of their affection to these toy so that   they would observe the moment whereat the very dumb animal which bred   about their house gave birth and then observed the relative position   of the heaven thereby to make fresh experiment in this socalled art   He said then that he had heard of his father that what time his mother   wa about to give birth to him Firminus a womanservant of that friend   of his father wa also with child which could not escape her master   who took care with most exact diligence to know the birth of his very   puppy And so it wa that the one for his wife and the other for his   servant with the most careful observation reckoning day hour   nay the lesser division of the hour both were delivered at the same   instant so that both were constrained to allow the same constellation   even to the minutest point the one for his son the other for his   newborn slave For so soon a the woman began to be in labour they   each gave notice to the other what wa fallen out in their house and   had messenger ready to send to one another so soon a they had notice   of the actual birth of which they had easily provided each in his own   province to give instant intelligence Thus then the messenger of   the respective party met he averred at such an equal distance from   either house that neither of them could make out any difference in the   position of the star or any other minutest point and yet Firminus   born in a high estate in his parent house ran his course through   the gilded path of life wa increased in rich raised to honour   whereas that slave continued to serve his master without any   relaxation of his yoke a Firminus who knew him told me     Upon hearing and believing these thing told by one of such   credibility all that my resistance gave way and first I endeavoured to   reclaim Firminus himself from that curiosity by telling him that upon   inspecting his constellation I ought if I were to predict truly to   have seen in them parent eminent among their neighbour a noble family   in it own city high birth good education liberal learning But if   that servant had consulted me upon the same constellation since they   were his also I ought again to tell him too truly to see in them   a lineage the most abject a slavish condition and every thing else   utterly at variance with the former Whence then if I spake the truth   I should from the same constellation speak diversely or if I   spake the same speak falsely thence it followed most certainly that   whatever upon consideration of the constellation wa spoken truly   wa spoken not out of art but chance and whatever spoken falsely wa   not out of ignorance in the art but the failure of the chance     An opening thus made ruminating with myself on the like thing that   no one of those dotard who lived by such a trade and whom I longed   to attack and with derision to confute might urge against me that   Firminus had informed me falsely or his father him I bent my thought   on those that are born twin who for the most part come out of the womb   so near one to other that the small interval how much force soever   in the nature of thing folk may pretend it to have can not be noted   by human observation or be at all expressed in those figure which the   astrologer is to inspect that he may pronounce truly Yet they can not   be true for looking into the same figure he must have predicted the   same of Esau and Jacob whereas the same happened not to them Therefore   he must speak falsely or if truly then looking into the same figure   he must not give the same answer Not by art then but by chance would   he speak truly For Thou O Lord most righteous Ruler of the Universe   while consulters and consulted know it not dost by Thy hidden   inspiration effect that the consulter should hear what according to the   hidden deservings of soul he ought to hear out of the unsearchable   depth of Thy just judgment to Whom let no man say What is this Why   that Let him not so say for he is man     Now then O my Helper hadst Thou loosed me from those fetter and I   sought whence is evil and found no way But Thou sufferedst me not by   any fluctuation of thought to be carried away from the Faith whereby I   believed Thee both to be and Thy substance to be unchangeable and that   Thou hast a care of and wouldest judge men and that in Christ Thy   Son Our Lord and the holy Scriptures which the authority of Thy   Catholic Church pressed upon me Thou hadst set the way of man   salvation to that life which is to be after this death These thing   being safe and immovably settled in my mind I sought anxiously whence   wa evil What were the pang of my teeming heart what groan O my   God yet even there were Thine ear open and I knew it not and when   in silence I vehemently sought those silent contrition of my soul were   strong cry unto Thy mercy Thou knewest what I suffered and no man   For what wa that which wa thence through my tongue distilled into the   ear of my most familiar friend Did the whole tumult of my soul for   which neither time nor utterance sufficed reach them Yet went up the   whole to Thy hearing all which I roared out from the groanings of my   heart and my desire wa before Thee and the light of mine eye wa not   with me for that wa within I without nor wa that confined to place   but I wa intent on thing contained in place but there found I no   restingplace nor did they so receive me that I could say It is   enough it is well nor did they yet suffer me to turn back where   it might be well enough with me For to these thing wa I superior but   inferior to Thee and Thou art my true joy when subjected to Thee and   Thou hadst subjected to me what Thou createdst below me And this wa   the true temperament and middle region of my safety to remain in   Thy Image and by serving Thee rule the body But when I rose proudly   against Thee and ran against the Lord with my neck with the thick   boss of my buckler even these inferior thing were set above me and   pressed me down and no where wa there respite or space of breathing   They met my sight on all side by heap and troop and in thought the   image thereof presented themselves unsought a I would return to   Thee a if they would say unto me Whither goest thou unworthy   and defiled And these thing had grown out of my wound for Thou   humbledst the proud like one that is wounded and through my own   swelling wa I separated from Thee yea my prideswollen face closed up   mine eye     But Thou Lord abidest for ever yet not for ever art Thou angry with   u because Thou pitiest our dust and ash and it wa pleasing in Thy   sight to reform my deformity and by inward goad didst Thou rouse me   that I should be ill at ease until Thou wert manifested to my inward   sight Thus by the secret hand of Thy medicining wa my swelling   abated and the troubled and bedimmed eyesight of my mind by the   smarting anointing of healthful sorrow wa from day to day healed     And Thou willing first to show me how Thou resistest the proud but   givest grace unto the humble and by how great an act of Thy mercy Thou   hadst traced out to men the way of humility in that Thy Word wa made   flesh and dwelt among menThou procuredst for me by mean of one   puffed up with most unnatural pride certain book of the Platonists   translated from Greek into Latin And therein I read not indeed in the   very word but to the very same purpose enforced by many and diver   reason that In the beginning wa the Word and the Word wa with God   and the Word wa God the Same wa in the beginning with God all thing   were made by Him and without Him wa nothing made that which wa made   by Him is life and the life wa the light of men and the light shineth   in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not And that the soul   of man though it bear witness to the light yet itself is not that   light but the Word of God being God is that true light that lighteth   every man that cometh into the world And that He wa in the world and   the world wa made by Him and the world knew Him not But that He came   unto His own and His own received Him not but a many a received Him   to them gave He power to become the son of God a many a believed in   His name this I read not there     Again I read there that God the Word wa born not of flesh nor of   blood nor of the will of man nor of the will of the flesh but of God   But that the Word wa made flesh and dwelt among u I read not there   For I traced in those book that it wa many and diver way said that   the Son wa in the form of the Father and thought it not robbery to be   equal with God for that naturally He wa the Same Substance But that   He emptied Himself taking the form of a servant being made in the   likeness of men and found in fashion a a man humbled Himself and   became obedient unto death and that the death of the cross wherefore   God exalted Him from the dead and gave Him a name above every name   that at the name of Jesus every knee should how of thing in heaven   and thing in earth and thing under the earth and that every tongue   should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the   Father those book have not For that before all time and above all   time Thy OnlyBegotten Son remaineth unchangeable coeternal with   Thee and that of His fulness soul receive that they may be blessed   and that by participation of wisdom abiding in them they are renewed   so a to be wise is there But that in due time He died for the   ungodly and that Thou sparedst not Thine Only Son but deliveredst Him   for u all is not there For Thou hiddest these thing from the wise   and revealedst them to babe that they that labour and are heavy laden   might come unto Him and He refresh them because He is meek and lowly   in heart and the meek He directeth in judgment and the gentle He   teacheth His way beholding our lowliness and trouble and forgiving   all our sin But such a are lifted up in the lofty walk of some   wouldbe sublimer learning hear not Him saying Learn of Me for I am   meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest to your soul Although   they knew God yet they glorify Him not a God nor are thankful   but wax vain in their thought and their foolish heart is darkened   professing that they were wise they became fool     And therefore did I read there also that they had changed the glory of   Thy incorruptible nature into idol and diver shape into the likeness   of the image of corruptible man and bird and beast and creeping   thing namely into that Egyptian food for which Esau lost his   birthright for that Thy firstborn people worshipped the head of a   fourfooted beast instead of Thee turning in heart back towards Egypt   and bowing Thy image their own soul before the image of a calf that   eateth hay These thing found I here but I fed not on them For it   pleased Thee O Lord to take away the reproach of diminution from   Jacob that the elder should serve the younger and Thou calledst the   Gentiles into Thine inheritance And I had come to Thee from among the   Gentiles and I set my mind upon the gold which Thou willedst Thy people   to take from Egypt seeing Thine it wa wheresoever it were And to the   Athenians Thou saidst by Thy Apostle that in Thee we live move and   have our being a one of their own poet had said And verily these   book came from thence But I set not my mind on the idol of Egypt   whom they served with Thy gold who changed the truth of God into a lie   and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator     And being thence admonished to return to myself I entered even into my   inward self Thou being my Guide and able I wa for Thou wert become   my Helper And I entered and beheld with the eye of my soul such a   it wa above the same eye of my soul above my mind the Light   Unchangeable Not this ordinary light which all flesh may look upon   nor a it were a greater of the same kind a though the brightness of   this should be manifold brighter and with it greatness take up all   space Not such wa this light but other yea far other from these   Nor wa it above my soul a oil is above water nor yet a heaven above   earth but above to my soul because It made me and I below It because   I wa made by It He that know the Truth know what that Light is   and he that know It know eternity Love knoweth it O Truth Who art   Eternity and Love Who art Truth and Eternity Who art Love Thou art   my God to Thee do I sigh night and day Thee when I first knew Thou   liftedst me up that I might see there wa what I might see and that I   wa not yet such a to see And Thou didst beat back the weakness of my   sight streaming forth Thy beam of light upon me most strongly and I   trembled with love and awe and I perceived myself to be far off from   Thee in the region of unlikeness a if I heard this Thy voice from on   high I am the food of grown men grow and thou shalt feed upon Me   nor shalt thou convert Me like the food of thy flesh into thee but   thou shalt be converted into Me And I learned that Thou for iniquity   chastenest man and Thou madest my soul to consume away like a spider   And I said Is Truth therefore nothing because it is not diffused   through space finite or infinite And Thou criedst to me from afar   Yet verily I AM that I AM And I heard a the heart heareth nor had   I room to doubt and I should sooner doubt that I live than that Truth   is not which is clearly seen being understood by those thing which   are made And I beheld the other thing below Thee and I perceived that   they neither altogether are nor altogether are not for they are since   they are from Thee but are not because they are not what Thou art For   that truly is which remains unchangeably It is good then for me to hold   fast unto God for if I remain not in Him I can not in myself but He   remaining in Himself reneweth all thing And Thou art the Lord my God   since Thou standest not in need of my goodness     And it wa manifested unto me that those thing be good which yet are   corrupted which neither were they sovereignly good nor unless they   were good could be corrupted for if sovereignly good they were   incorruptible if not good at all there were nothing in them to be   corrupted For corruption injures but unless it diminished goodness it   could not injure Either then corruption injures not which can not be   or which is most certain all which is corrupted is deprived of good   But if they be deprived of all good they shall cease to be For if they   shall be and can now no longer be corrupted they shall be better than   before because they shall abide incorruptibly And what more monstrous   than to affirm thing to become better by losing all their good   Therefore if they shall be deprived of all good they shall no longer   be So long therefore a they are they are good therefore whatsoever   is is good That evil then which I sought whence it is is not any   substance for were it a substance it should be good For either   it should be an incorruptible substance and so a chief good or   a corruptible substance which unless it were good could not be   corrupted I perceived therefore and it wa manifested to me that Thou   madest all thing good nor is there any substance at all which Thou   madest not and for that Thou madest not all thing equal therefore are   all thing because each is good and altogether very good because our   God made all thing very good     And to Thee is nothing whatsoever evil yea not only to Thee but also   to Thy creation a a whole because there is nothing without which may   break in and corrupt that order which Thou hast appointed it But in   the part thereof some thing because unharmonising with other some   are accounted evil whereas those very thing harmonise with others   and are good and in themselves are good And all these thing which   harmonise not together do yet with the inferior part which we call   Earth having it own cloudy and windy sky harmonising with it Far be   it then that I should say These thing should not be for should I   see nought but these I should indeed long for the better but still   must even for these alone praise Thee for that Thou art to be praised   do show from the earth dragon and all deep fire hail snow   ice and stormy wind which fulfil Thy word mountain and all hill   fruitful tree and all cedar beast and all cattle creeping thing   and flying fowl king of the earth and all people prince and all   judge of the earth young men and maiden old men and young praise   Thy Name But when from heaven these praise Thee praise Thee our   God in the height all Thy angel all Thy host sun and moon all the   star and light the Heaven of heaven and the water that be above the   heaven praise Thy Name I did not now long for thing better because   I conceived of all and with a sounder judgment I apprehended that the   thing above were better than these below but altogether better than   those above by themselves     There is no soundness in them whom aught of Thy creation displeaseth   a neither in me when much which Thou hast made displeased me And   because my soul durst not be displeased at my God it would fain not   account that Thine which displeased it Hence it had gone into the   opinion of two substance and had no rest but talked idly And   returning thence it had made to itself a God through infinite measure   of all space and thought it to be Thee and placed it in it heart   and had again become the temple of it own idol to Thee abominable But   after Thou hadst soothed my head unknown to me and closed mine eye   that they should not behold vanity I ceased somewhat of my former self   and my frenzy wa lulled to sleep and I awoke in Thee and saw Thee   infinite but in another way and this sight wa not derived from the   flesh     And I looked back on other thing and I saw that they owed their being   to Thee and were all bounded in Thee but in a different way not a   being in space but because Thou containest all thing in Thine hand   in Thy Truth and all thing are true so far a they nor is there any   falsehood unless when that is thought to be which is not And I saw   that all thing did harmonise not with their place only but with   their season And that Thou who only art Eternal didst not begin to   work after innumerable space of time spent for that all space of   time both which have passed and which shall pas neither go nor   come but through Thee working and abiding     And I perceived and found it nothing strange that bread which is   pleasant to a healthy palate is loathsome to one distempered and to   sore eye light is offensive which to the sound is delightful And Thy   righteousness displeaseth the wicked much more the viper and reptile   which Thou hast created good fitting in with the inferior portion of   Thy Creation with which the very wicked also fit in and that the more   by how much they be unlike Thee but with the superior creature by how   much they become more like to Thee And I enquired what iniquity wa   and found it to be no substance but the perversion of the will turned   aside from Thee O God the Supreme towards these lower thing and   casting out it bowel and puffed up outwardly     And I wondered that I now loved Thee and no phantasm for Thee And   yet did I not press on to enjoy my God but wa borne up to Thee by Thy   beauty and soon borne down from Thee by mine own weight sinking with   sorrow into these inferior thing This weight wa carnal custom Yet   dwelt there with me a remembrance of Thee nor did I any way doubt that   there wa One to whom I might cleave but that I wa not yet such a to   cleave to Thee for that the body which is corrupted presseth down the   soul and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon   many thing And most certain I wa that Thy invisible work from the   creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the thing   that are made even Thy eternal power and Godhead For examining whence   it wa that I admired the beauty of body celestial or terrestrial   and what aided me in judging soundly on thing mutable and pronouncing   This ought to be thus this not examining I say whence it wa that   I so judged seeing I did so judge I had found the unchangeable and   true Eternity of Truth above my changeable mind And thus by degree   I passed from body to the soul which through the bodily sens   perceives and thence to it inward faculty to which the bodily sens   represent thing external whitherto reach the faculty of beast and   thence again to the reasoning faculty to which what is received from   the sens of the body is referred to be judged Which finding   itself also to be in me a thing variable raised itself up to it   own understanding and drew away my thought from the power of habit   withdrawing itself from those troop of contradictory phantasm that so   it might find what that light wa whereby it wa bedewed when without   all doubting it cried out That the unchangeable wa to be preferred   to the changeable whence also it knew That Unchangeable which unless   it had in some way known it had had no sure ground to prefer it to the   changeable And thus with the flash of one trembling glance it arrived   at THAT WHICH IS And then I saw Thy invisible thing understood by   the thing which are made But I could not fix my gaze thereon and my   infirmity being struck back I wa thrown again on my wonted habit   carrying along with me only a loving memory thereof and a longing for   what I had a it were perceived the odour of but wa not yet able to   feed on     Then I sought a way of obtaining strength sufficient to enjoy Thee and   found it not until I embraced that Mediator betwixt God and men the   Man Christ Jesus who is over all God blessed for evermore calling   unto me and saying I am the way the truth and the life and mingling   that food which I wa unable to receive with our flesh For the Word   wa made flesh that Thy wisdom whereby Thou createdst all thing   might provide milk for our infant state For I did not hold to my Lord   Jesus Christ I humbled to the Humble nor knew I yet whereto His   infirmity would guide u For Thy Word the Eternal Truth far above the   higher part of Thy Creation raise up the subdued unto Itself but   in this lower world built for Itself a lowly habitation of our clay   whereby to abase from themselves such a would be subdued and bring   them over to Himself allaying their swelling and fomenting their love   to the end they might go on no further in selfconfidence but rather   consent to become weak seeing before their foot the Divinity weak by   taking our coat of skin and wearied might cast themselves down upon   It and It rising might lift them up     But I thought otherwise conceiving only of my Lord Christ a of a man   of excellent wisdom whom no one could be equalled unto especially   for that being wonderfully born of a Virgin He seemed in conformity   therewith through the Divine care for u to have attained that great   eminence of authority for an ensample of despising thing temporal for   the obtaining of immortality But what mystery there lay in The Word   wa made flesh I could not even imagine Only I had learnt out of what   is delivered to u in writing of Him that He did eat and drink sleep   walk rejoiced in spirit wa sorrowful discoursed that flesh did not   cleave by itself unto Thy Word but with the human soul and mind All   know this who know the unchangeableness of Thy Word which I now knew   a far a I could nor did I at all doubt thereof For now to move the   limb of the body by will now not now to be moved by some affection   now not now to deliver wise saying through human sign now to keep   silence belong to soul and mind subject to variation And should these   thing be falsely written of Him all the rest also would risk the   charge nor would there remain in those book any saving faith for   mankind Since then they were written truly I acknowledged a perfect   man to be in Christ not the body of a man only nor with the body a   sensitive soul without a rational but very man whom not only a being   a form of Truth but for a certain great excellence of human nature and   a more perfect participation of wisdom I judged to be preferred before   others But Alypius imagined the Catholics to believe God to be so   clothed with flesh that besides God and flesh there wa no soul at all   in Christ and did not think that a human mind wa ascribed to Him And   because he wa well persuaded that the action recorded of Him could   only be performed by a vital and a rational creature he moved the more   slowly towards the Christian Faith But understanding afterwards that   this wa the error of the Apollinarian heretic he joyed in and wa   conformed to the Catholic Faith But somewhat later I confess did I   learn how in that saying The Word wa made flesh the Catholic truth   is distinguished from the falsehood of Photinus For the rejection of   heretic make the tenet of Thy Church and sound doctrine to stand out   more clearly For there must also be heresy that the approved may be   made manifest among the weak     But having then read those book of the Platonists and thence been   taught to search for incorporeal truth I saw Thy invisible thing   understood by those thing which are made and though cast back I   perceived what that wa which through the darkness of my mind I wa   hindered from contemplating being assured That Thou wert and wert   infinite and yet not diffused in space finite or infinite and that   Thou truly art Who art the same ever in no part nor motion varying   and that all other thing are from Thee on this most sure ground alone   that they are Of these thing I wa assured yet too unsure to enjoy   Thee I prated a one well skilled but had I not sought Thy way in   Christ our Saviour I had proved to be not skilled but killed For now   I had begun to wish to seem wise being filled with mine own punishment   yet I did not mourn but rather scorn puffed up with knowledge For   where wa that charity building upon the foundation of humility which   is Christ Jesus or when should these book teach me it Upon these I   believe Thou therefore willedst that I should fall before I studied   Thy Scriptures that it might be imprinted on my memory how I wa   affected by them and that afterwards when my spirit were tamed through   Thy book and my wound touched by Thy healing finger I might discern   and distinguish between presumption and confession between those who   saw whither they were to go yet saw not the way and the way that   leadeth not to behold only but to dwell in the beatific country For   had I first been formed in Thy Holy Scriptures and hadst Thou in the   familiar use of them grown sweet unto me and had I then fallen upon   those other volume they might perhaps have withdrawn me from the solid   ground of piety or had I continued in that healthful frame which I had   thence imbibed I might have thought that it might have been obtained by   the study of those book alone     Most eagerly then did I seize that venerable writing of Thy Spirit and   chiefly the Apostle Paul Whereupon those difficulty vanished away   wherein he once seemed to me to contradict himself and the text of his   discourse not to agree with the testimony of the Law and the Prophets   And the face of that pure word appeared to me one and the same and I   learned to rejoice with trembling So I began and whatsoever truth   I had read in those other book I found here amid the praise of Thy   Grace that whoso see may not so glory a if he had not received not   only what he see but also that he see for what hath he which he   hath not received and that he may be not only admonished to behold   Thee who art ever the same but also healed to hold Thee and that he   who can not see afar off may yet walk on the way whereby he may arrive   and behold and hold Thee For though a man be delighted with the law   of God after the inner man what shall he do with that other law in his   member which warreth against the law of his mind and bringeth him   into captivity to the law of sin which is in his member For Thou art   righteous O Lord but we have sinned and committed iniquity and have   done wickedly and Thy hand is grown heavy upon u and we are justly   delivered over unto that ancient sinner the king of death because   he persuaded our will to be like his will whereby he abode not in Thy   truth What shall wretched man do who shall deliver him from the body   of his death but only Thy Grace through Jesus Christ our Lord whom   Thou hast begotten coeternal and formedst in the beginning of Thy   way in whom the prince of this world found nothing worthy of death   yet killed he Him and the handwriting which wa contrary to u wa   blotted out This those writing contain not Those page present not   the image of this piety the tear of confession Thy sacrifice a   troubled spirit a broken and a contrite heart the salvation of the   people the Bridal City the earnest of the Holy Ghost the Cup of our   Redemption No man sings there Shall not my soul be submitted unto God   for of Him cometh my salvation For He is my God and my salvation my   guardian I shall no more be moved No one there hears Him call Come   unto Me all ye that labour They scorn to learn of Him because He is   meek and lowly in heart for these thing hast Thou hid from the wise   and prudent and hast revealed them unto babe For it is one thing   from the mountain shaggy top to see the land of peace and to find no   way thither and in vain to essay through way unpassable opposed and   beset by fugitive and deserter under their captain the lion and the   dragon and another to keep on the way that lead thither guarded by   the host of the heavenly General where they spoil not who have deserted   the heavenly army for they avoid it a very torment These thing did   wonderfully sink into my bowel when I read that least of Thy Apostles   and had meditated upon Thy work and trembled exceedingly           BOOK VIII       O my God let me with thanksgiving remember and confess unto Thee Thy   mercy on me Let my bone be bedewed with Thy love and let them say   unto Thee Who is like unto Thee O Lord Thou hast broken my bond in   sunder I will offer unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving And how   Thou hast broken them I will declare and all who worship Thee when   they hear this shall say Blessed be the Lord in heaven and in earth   great and wonderful is his name Thy word had stuck fast in my heart   and I wa hedged round about on all side by Thee Of Thy eternal life I   wa now certain though I saw it in a figure and a through a glass Yet   I had ceased to doubt that there wa an incorruptible substance whence   wa all other substance nor did I now desire to be more certain of   Thee but more steadfast in Thee But for my temporal life all wa   wavering and my heart had to be purged from the old leaven The Way   the Saviour Himself well pleased me but a yet I shrunk from going   through it straitness And Thou didst put into my mind and it seemed   good in my eye to go to Simplicianus who seemed to me a good servant   of Thine and Thy grace shone in him I had heard also that from his   very youth he had lived most devoted unto Thee Now he wa grown into   year and by reason of so great age spent in such zealous following of   Thy way he seemed to me likely to have learned much experience and   so he had Out of which store I wished that he would tell me setting   before him my anxiety which were the fittest way for one in my case   to walk in Thy path     For I saw the church full and one went this way and another that way   But I wa displeased that I led a secular life yea now that my desire   no longer inflamed me a of old with hope of honour and profit   a very grievous burden it wa to undergo so heavy a bondage For in   comparison of Thy sweetness and the beauty of Thy house which I loved   those thing delighted me no longer But still I wa enthralled with   the love of woman nor did the Apostle forbid me to marry although he   advised me to something better chiefly wishing that all men were a   himself wa But I being weak chose the more indulgent place and   because of this alone wa tossed up and down in all beside faint and   wasted with withering care because in other matter I wa constrained   against my will to conform myself to a married life to which I wa   given up and enthralled I had heard from the mouth of the Truth   that there were some eunuch which had made themselves eunuch for the   kingdom of heaven sake but saith He let him who can receive it   receive it Surely vain are all men who are ignorant of God and could   not out of the good thing which are seen find out Him who is good But   I wa no longer in that vanity I had surmounted it and by the common   witness of all Thy creature had found Thee our Creator and Thy Word   God with Thee and together with Thee one God by whom Thou createdst   all thing There is yet another kind of ungodly who knowing God   glorified Him not a God neither were thankful Into this also had   I fallen but Thy right hand upheld me and took me thence and Thou   placedst me where I might recover For Thou hast said unto man Behold   the fear of the Lord is wisdom and Desire not to seem wise because   they who affirmed themselves to be wise became fool But I had now   found the goodly pearl which selling all that I had I ought to have   bought and I hesitated     To Simplicianus then I went the father of Ambrose a Bishop now in   receiving Thy grace and whom Ambrose truly loved a a father To him I   related the maze of my wandering But when I mentioned that I had read   certain book of the Platonists which Victorinus sometime Rhetoric   Professor of Rome who had died a Christian a I had heard had   translated into Latin he testified his joy that I had not fallen upon   the writing of other philosopher full of fallacy and deceit after   the rudiment of this world whereas the Platonists many way led to the   belief in God and His Word Then to exhort me to the humility of   Christ hidden from the wise and revealed to little one he spoke of   Victorinus himself whom while at Rome he had most intimately known and   of him he related what I will not conceal For it contains great praise   of Thy grace to be confessed unto Thee how that aged man most learned   and skilled in the liberal science and who had read and weighed   so many work of the philosopher the instructor of so many noble   Senators who also a a monument of his excellent discharge of his   office had which men of this world esteem a high honour both deserved   and obtained a statue in the Roman Forum he to that age a worshipper   of idol and a partaker of the sacrilegious rite to which almost all   the nobility of Rome were given up and had inspired the people with the   love of              Anubis barking Deity and all            The monster Gods of every kind who fought            Gainst Neptune Venus and Minerva     whom Rome once conquered now adored all which the aged Victorinus had   with thundering eloquence so many year defendedhe now blushed not   to be the child of Thy Christ and the newborn babe of Thy fountain   submitting his neck to the yoke of humility and subduing his forehead   to the reproach of the Cross     O Lord Lord Which hast bowed the heaven and come down touched the   mountain and they did smoke by what mean didst Thou convey Thyself   into that breast He used to read a Simplicianus said the holy   Scripture most studiously sought and searched into all the Christian   writing and said to Simplicianus not openly but privately and a   a friend Understand that I am already a Christian Whereto he   answered I will not believe it nor will I rank you among Christians   unless I see you in the Church of Christ The other in banter   replied Do wall then make Christians And this he often said that   he wa already a Christian and Simplicianus a often made the same   answer and the conceit of the wall wa by the other a often   renewed For he feared to offend his friend proud daemonworshippers   from the height of whose Babylonian dignity a from cedar of Libanus   which the Lord had not yet broken down he supposed the weight of enmity   would fall upon him But after that by reading and earnest thought he   had gathered firmness and feared to be denied by Christ before the holy   angel should he now be afraid to confess Him before men and appeared   to himself guilty of a heavy offence in being ashamed of the Sacraments   of the humility of Thy Word and not being ashamed of the sacrilegious   rite of those proud daemon whose pride he had imitated and their   rite adopted he became boldfaced against vanity and shamefaced   towards the truth and suddenly and unexpectedly said to Simplicianus   a himself told me Go we to the Church I wish to be made a   Christian But he not containing himself for joy went with him And   having been admitted to the first Sacrament and become a Catechumen not   long after he further gave in his name that he might be regenerated by   baptism Rome wondering the Church rejoicing The proud saw and were   wroth they gnashed with their teeth and melted away But the Lord   God wa the hope of Thy servant and he regarded not vanity and lying   madness     To conclude when the hour wa come for making profession of his faith   which at Rome they who are about to approach to Thy grace deliver   from an elevated place in the sight of all the faithful in a set   form of word committed to memory the presbyter he said offered   Victorinus a wa done to such a seemed likely through bashfulness to   be alarmed to make his profession more privately but he chose rather   to profess his salvation in the presence of the holy multitude For   it wa not salvation that he taught in rhetoric and yet that he had   publicly professed how much le then ought he when pronouncing Thy   word to dread Thy meek flock who when delivering his own word   had not feared a mad multitude When then he went up to make his   profession all a they knew him whispered his name one to another   with the voice of congratulation And who there knew him not and there   ran a low murmur through all the mouth of the rejoicing multitude   Victorinus Victorinus Sudden wa the burst of rapture that they saw   him suddenly were they hushed that they might hear him He pronounced   the true faith with an excellent boldness and all wished to draw him   into their very heart yea by their love and joy they drew him thither   such were the hand wherewith they drew him     Good God what take place in man that he should more rejoice at the   salvation of a soul despaired of and freed from greater peril than if   there had always been hope of him or the danger had been le For so   Thou also merciful Father dost more rejoice over one penitent than   over ninetynine just person that need no repentance And with much   joyfulness do we hear so often a we hear with what joy the sheep which   had strayed is brought back upon the shepherd shoulder and the groat   is restored to Thy treasury the neighbour rejoicing with the woman   who found it and the joy of the solemn service of Thy house forceth   to tear when in Thy house it is read of Thy younger son that he wa   dead and liveth again had been lost and is found For Thou rejoicest   in u and in Thy holy angel holy through holy charity For Thou art   ever the same for all thing which abide not the same nor for ever   Thou for ever knowest in the same way     What then take place in the soul when it is more delighted at finding   or recovering the thing it love than if it had ever had them yea   and other thing witness hereunto and all thing are full of witness   cry out So is it The conquering commander triumpheth yet had he   not conquered unless he had fought and the more peril there wa in the   battle so much the more joy is there in the triumph The storm toss   the sailor threatens shipwreck all wax pale at approaching death   sky and sea are calmed and they are exceeding joyed a having been   exceeding afraid A friend is sick and his pulse threatens danger all   who long for his recovery are sick in mind with him He is restored   though a yet he walk not with his former strength yet there is such   joy a wa not when before he walked sound and strong Yea the very   pleasure of human life men acquire by difficulty not those only   which fall upon u unlooked for and against our will but even by   selfchosen and pleasureseeking trouble Eating and drinking have no   pleasure unless there precede the pinching of hunger and thirst Men   given to drink eat certain salt meat to procure a troublesome heat   which the drink allaying cause pleasure It is also ordered that the   affianced bride should not at once be given lest a a husband he should   hold cheap whom a betrothed he sighed not after     This law hold in foul and accursed joy this in permitted and lawful   joy this in the very purest perfection of friendship this in him who   wa dead and lived again had been lost and wa found Every where the   greater joy is ushered in by the greater pain What mean this O Lord   my God whereas Thou art everlastingly joy to Thyself and some thing   around Thee evermore rejoice in Thee What mean this that this portion   of thing thus ebb and flow alternately displeased and reconciled   Is this their allotted measure Is this all Thou hast assigned to them   whereas from the highest heaven to the lowest earth from the beginning   of the world to the end of age from the angel to the worm from the   first motion to the last Thou settest each in it place and realisest   each in their season every thing good after it kind Woe is me how   high art Thou in the highest and how deep in the deepest and Thou   never departest and we scarcely return to Thee     Up Lord and do stir u up and recall u kindle and draw u   inflame grow sweet unto u let u now love let u run Do not many   out of a deeper hell of blindness than Victorinus return to Thee   approach and are enlightened receiving that Light which they who   receive receive power from Thee to become Thy son But if they be le   known to the nation even they that know them joy le for them For   when many joy together each also ha more exuberant joy for that they   are kindled and inflamed one by the other Again because those known to   many influence the more towards salvation and lead the way with many   to follow And therefore do they also who preceded them much rejoice in   them because they rejoice not in them alone For far be it that in Thy   tabernacle the person of the rich should be accepted before the poor   or the noble before the ignoble seeing rather Thou hast chosen the weak   thing of the world to confound the strong and the base thing of this   world and the thing despised hast Thou chosen and those thing which   are not that Thou mightest bring to nought thing that are And yet   even that least of Thy apostle by whose tongue Thou soundedst forth   these word when through his warfare Paulus the Proconsul his pride   conquered wa made to pas under the easy yoke of Thy Christ and   became a provincial of the great King he also for his former name Saul   wa pleased to be called Paul in testimony of so great a victory For   the enemy is more overcome in one of whom he hath more hold by whom   he hath hold of more But the proud he hath more hold of through their   nobility and by them of more through their authority By how much the   more welcome then the heart of Victorinus wa esteemed which the devil   had held a an impregnable possession the tongue of Victorinus   with which mighty and keen weapon he had slain many so much the more   abundantly ought Thy son to rejoice for that our King hath bound the   strong man and they saw his vessel taken from him and cleansed and   made meet for Thy honour and become serviceable for the Lord unto   every good work     But when that man of Thine Simplicianus related to me this of   Victorinus I wa on fire to imitate him for for this very end had   he related it But when he had subjoined also how in the day of the   Emperor Julian a law wa made whereby Christians were forbidden to   teach the liberal science or oratory and how he obeying this law   chose rather to give over the wordy school than Thy Word by which   Thou makest eloquent the tongue of the dumb he seemed to me not more   resolute than blessed in having thus found opportunity to wait on Thee   only Which thing I wa sighing for bound a I wa not with anothers   iron but by my own iron will My will the enemy held and thence had   made a chain for me and bound me For of a forward will wa a lust   made and a lust served became custom and custom not resisted became   necessity By which link a it were joined together whence I called   it a chain a hard bondage held me enthralled But that new will which   had begun to be in me freely to serve Thee and to wish to enjoy Thee   O God the only assured pleasantness wa not yet able to overcome my   former wilfulness strengthened by age Thus did my two will one new   and the other old one carnal the other spiritual struggle within me   and by their discord undid my soul     Thus I understood by my own experience what I had read how the flesh   lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh Myself   verily either way yet more myself in that which I approved in myself   than in that which in myself I disapproved For in this last it wa now   for the more part not myself because in much I rather endured against   my will than acted willingly And yet it wa through me that custom had   obtained this power of warring against me because I had come willingly   whither I willed not And who ha any right to speak against it if just   punishment follow the sinner Nor had I now any longer my former plea   that I therefore a yet hesitated to be above the world and serve Thee   for that the truth wa not altogether ascertained to me for now it too   wa But I still under service to the earth refused to fight under Thy   banner and feared a much to be freed of all incumbrance a we should   fear to be encumbered with it Thus with the baggage of this present   world wa I held down pleasantly a in sleep and the thought wherein   I meditated on Thee were like the effort of such a would awake who   yet overcome with a heavy drowsiness are again drenched therein And a   no one would sleep for ever and in all men sober judgment waking is   better yet a man for the most part feeling a heavy lethargy in all his   limb defers to shake off sleep and though half displeased yet even   after it is time to rise with pleasure yield to it so wa I assured   that much better were it for me to give myself up to Thy charity than   to give myself over to mine own cupidity but though the former course   satisfied me and gained the mastery the latter pleased me and held me   mastered Nor had I any thing to answer Thee calling to me Awake   thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee   light And when Thou didst on all side show me that what Thou saidst   wa true I convicted by the truth had nothing at all to answer but   only those dull and drowsy word Anon anon presently leave   me but a little But presently presently had no present and my   little while went on for a long while in vain I delighted in Thy   law according to the inner man when another law in my member rebelled   against the law of my mind and led me captive under the law of sin   which wa in my member For the law of sin is the violence of custom   whereby the mind is drawn and holden even against it will but   deservedly for that it willingly fell into it Who then should deliver   me thus wretched from the body of this death but Thy grace only   through Jesus Christ our Lord     And how Thou didst deliver me out of the bond of desire wherewith I   wa bound most straitly to carnal concupiscence and out of the drudgery   of worldly thing I will now declare and confess unto Thy name O   Lord my helper and my redeemer Amid increasing anxiety I wa doing   my wonted business and daily sighing unto Thee I attended Thy Church   whenever free from the business under the burden of which I groaned   Alypius wa with me now after the third sitting released from his law   business and awaiting to whom to sell his counsel a I sold the skill   of speaking if indeed teaching can impart it Nebridius had now in   consideration of our friendship consented to teach under Verecundus a   citizen and a grammarian of Milan and a very intimate friend of u all   who urgently desired and by the right of friendship challenged from our   company such faithful aid a he greatly needed Nebridius then wa not   drawn to this by any desire of advantage for he might have made much   more of his learning had he so willed but a a most kind and gentle   friend he would not be wanting to a good office and slight our   request But he acted herein very discreetly shunning to become known   to personage great according to this world avoiding the distraction   of mind thence ensuing and desiring to have it free and at leisure a   many hour a might be to seek or read or hear something concerning   wisdom     Upon a day then Nebridius being absent I recollect not why lo there   came to see me and Alypius one Pontitianus our countryman so far a   being an African in high office in the Emperors court What he would   with u I know not but we sat down to converse and it happened that   upon a table for some game before u he observed a book took opened   it and contrary to his expectation found it the Apostle Paul for he   thought it some of those book which I wa wearing myself in teaching   Whereat smiling and looking at me he expressed his joy and wonder that   he had on a sudden found this book and this only before my eye For he   wa a Christian and baptised and often bowed himself before Thee our   God in the Church in frequent and continued prayer When then I had   told him that I bestowed very great pain upon those Scriptures a   conversation arose suggested by his account on Antony the Egyptian   monk whose name wa in high reputation among Thy servant though to   that hour unknown to u Which when he discovered he dwelt the more   upon that subject informing and wondering at our ignorance of one so   eminent But we stood amazed hearing Thy wonderful work most fully   attested in time so recent and almost in our own wrought in the true   Faith and Church Catholic We all wondered we that they were so great   and he that they had not reached u     Thence his discourse turned to the flock in the monastery and their   holy way a sweetsmelling savour unto Thee and the fruitful desert   of the wilderness whereof we knew nothing And there wa a monastery   at Milan full of good brother without the city wall under the   fostering care of Ambrose and we knew it not He went on with his   discourse and we listened in intent silence He told u then how one   afternoon at Triers when the Emperor wa taken up with the Circensian   game he and three others his companion went out to walk in garden   near the city wall and there a they happened to walk in pair one   went apart with him and the other two wandered by themselves and   these in their wandering lighted upon a certain cottage inhabited   by certain of Thy servant poor in spirit of whom is the kingdom   of heaven and there they found a little book containing the life of   Antony This one of them began to read admire and kindle at it and   a he read to meditate on taking up such a life and giving over his   secular service to serve Thee And these two were of those whom they   style agent for the public affair Then suddenly filled with a holy   love and a sober shame in anger with himself cast his eye upon his   friend saying Tell me I pray thee what would we attain by all these   labour of ours what aim we at what serve we for Can our hope in   court rise higher than to be the Emperors favourite and in this what   is there not brittle and full of peril and by how many peril arrive   we at a greater peril and when arrive we thither But a friend of God   if I wish it I become now at once So spake he And in pain with the   travail of a new life he turned his eye again upon the book and   read on and wa changed inwardly where Thou sawest and his mind wa   stripped of the world a soon appeared For a he read and rolled up   and down the wave of his heart he stormed at himself a while then   discerned and determined on a better course and now being Thine said   to his friend Now have I broken loose from those our hope and am   resolved to serve God and this from this hour in this place I begin   upon If thou likest not to imitate me oppose not The other answered   he would cleave to him to partake so glorious a reward so glorious   a service Thus both being now Thine were building the tower at the   necessary cost the forsaking all that they had and following Thee   Then Pontitianus and the other with him that had walked in other part   of the garden came in search of them to the same place and finding   them reminded them to return for the day wa now far spent But they   relating their resolution and purpose and how that will wa begun and   settled in them begged them if they would not join not to molest   them But the others though nothing altered from their former self   did yet bewail themselves a he affirmed and piously congratulated   them recommending themselves to their prayer and so with heart   lingering on the earth went away to the palace But the other two   fixing their heart on heaven remained in the cottage And both had   affianced bride who when they heard hereof also dedicated their   virginity unto God     Such wa the story of Pontitianus but Thou O Lord while he wa   speaking didst turn me round towards myself taking me from behind my   back where I had placed me unwilling to observe myself and setting   me before my face that I might see how foul I wa how crooked and   defiled bespotted and ulcerous And I beheld and stood aghast and   whither to flee from myself I found not And if I sought to turn mine   eye from off myself he went on with his relation and Thou again didst   set me over against myself and thrustedst me before my eye that I   might find out mine iniquity and hate it I had known it but made a   though I saw it not winked at it and forgot it     But now the more ardently I loved those whose healthful affection I   heard of that they had resigned themselves wholly to Thee to be cured   the more did I abhor myself when compared with them For many of my   year some twelve had now run out with me since my nineteenth when   upon the reading of Ciceros Hortensius I wa stirred to an earnest   love of wisdom and still I wa deferring to reject mere earthly   felicity and give myself to search out that whereof not the finding   only but the very search wa to be preferred to the treasure and   kingdom of the world though already found and to the pleasure of the   body though spread around me at my will But I wretched most wretched   in the very commencement of my early youth had begged chastity of Thee   and said Give me chastity and continency only not yet For I feared   lest Thou shouldest hear me soon and soon cure me of the disease   of concupiscence which I wished to have satisfied rather than   extinguished And I had wandered through crooked way in a sacrilegious   superstition not indeed assured thereof but a preferring it to the   others which I did not seek religiously but opposed maliciously     And I had thought that I therefore deferred from day to day to reject   the hope of this world and follow Thee only because there did not   appear aught certain whither to direct my course And now wa the day   come wherein I wa to be laid bare to myself and my conscience wa   to upbraid me Where art thou now my tongue Thou saidst that for an   uncertain truth thou likedst not to cast off the baggage of vanity now   it is certain and yet that burden still oppresseth thee while they who   neither have so worn themselves out with seeking it nor for often year   and more have been thinking thereon have had their shoulder lightened   and received wing to fly away Thus wa I gnawed within and   exceedingly confounded with a horrible shame while Pontitianus wa so   speaking And he having brought to a close his tale and the business   he came for went his way and I into myself What said I not against   myself with what scourge of condemnation lashed I not my soul that it   might follow me striving to go after Thee Yet it drew back refused   but excused not itself All argument were spent and confuted there   remained a mute shrinking and she feared a she would death to be   restrained from the flux of that custom whereby she wa wasting to   death     Then in this great contention of my inward dwelling which I had   strongly raised against my soul in the chamber of my heart troubled in   mind and countenance I turned upon Alypius What ail u I exclaim   what is it what heardest thou The unlearned start up and take heaven   by force and we with our learning and without heart lo where we   wallow in flesh and blood Are we ashamed to follow because others   are gone before and not ashamed not even to follow Some such word I   uttered and my fever of mind tore me away from him while he gazing on   me in astonishment kept silence For it wa not my wonted tone and my   forehead cheek eye colour tone of voice spake my mind more than   the word I uttered A little garden there wa to our lodging which we   had the use of a of the whole house for the master of the house our   host wa not living there Thither had the tumult of my breast hurried   me where no man might hinder the hot contention wherein I had engaged   with myself until it should end a Thou knewest I knew not Only I   wa healthfully distracted and dying to live knowing what evil thing I   wa and not knowing what good thing I wa shortly to become I retired   then into the garden and Alypius on my step For his presence did not   lessen my privacy or how could he forsake me so disturbed We sate down   a far removed a might be from the house I wa troubled in spirit   most vehemently indignant that I entered not into Thy will and covenant   O my God which all my bone cried out unto me to enter and praised it   to the sky And therein we enter not by ship or chariot or foot   no move not so far a I had come from the house to that place where we   were sitting For not to go only but to go in thither wa nothing else   but to will to go but to will resolutely and thoroughly not to turn   and toss this way and that a maimed and halfdivided will struggling   with one part sinking a another rose     Lastly in the very fever of my irresoluteness I made with my body many   such motion a men sometimes would but can not if either they have not   the limb or these be bound with band weakened with infirmity or   any other way hindered Thus if I tore my hair beat my forehead if   locking my finger I clasped my knee I willed I did it But I might   have willed and not done it if the power of motion in my limb had not   obeyed So many thing then I did when to will wa not in itself to   be able and I did not what both I longed incomparably more to do and   which soon after when I should will I should be able to do because   soon after when I should will I should will thoroughly For in these   thing the ability wa one with the will and to will wa to do and yet   wa it not done and more easily did my body obey the weakest willing of   my soul in moving it limb at it nod than the soul obeyed itself to   accomplish in the will alone this it momentous will     Whence is this monstrousness and to what end Let Thy mercy gleam that   I may ask if so be the secret penalty of men and those darkest   pang of the son of Adam may perhaps answer me Whence is this   monstrousness and to what end The mind command the body and it obeys   instantly the mind command itself and is resisted The mind command   the hand to be moved and such readiness is there that command is   scarce distinct from obedience Yet the mind is mind the hand is body   The mind command the mind it own self to will and yet it doth not   Whence this monstrousness and to what end It command itself I say   to will and would not command unless it willed and what it command   is not done But it willeth not entirely therefore doth it not command   entirely For so far forth it commandeth a it willeth and so far   forth is the thing commanded not done a it willeth not For the will   commandeth that there be a will not another but itself But it doth   not command entirely therefore what it commandeth is not For were   the will entire it would not even command it to be because it would   already be It is therefore no monstrousness partly to will partly to   nill but a disease of the mind that it doth not wholly rise by truth   upborne borne down by custom And therefore are there two will for   that one of them is not entire and what the one lacketh the other   hath     Let them perish from Thy presence O God a perish vain talker and   seducer of the soul who observing that in deliberating there were two   will affirm that there are two mind in u of two kind one good the   other evil Themselves are truly evil when they hold these evil thing   and themselves shall become good when they hold the truth and assent   unto the truth that Thy Apostle may say to them Ye were sometimes   darkness but now light in the Lord But they wishing to be light not   in the Lord but in themselves imagining the nature of the soul to   be that which God is are made more gross darkness through a dreadful   arrogancy for that they went back farther from Thee the true Light   that enlightened every man that cometh into the world Take heed what   you say and blush for shame draw near unto Him and be enlightened   and your face shall not be ashamed Myself when I wa deliberating   upon serving the Lord my God now a I had long purposed it wa I who   willed I who nilled I I myself I neither willed entirely nor nilled   entirely Therefore wa I at strife with myself and rent asunder by   myself And this rent befell me against my will and yet indicated not   the presence of another mind but the punishment of my own Therefore it   wa no more I that wrought it but sin that dwelt in me the punishment   of a sin more freely committed in that I wa a son of Adam     For if there be so many contrary nature a there be conflicting will   there shall now be not two only but many If a man deliberate whether   he should go to their conventicle or to the theatre these Manichees   cry out Behold here are two nature one good draw this way another   bad draw back that way For whence else is this hesitation between   conflicting will But I say that both be bad that which draw to them   a that which draw back to the theatre But they believe not that   will to be other than good which draw to them What then if one of u   should deliberate and amid the strife of his two will be in a strait   whether he should go to the theatre or to our church would not these   Manichees also be in a strait what to answer For either they must   confess which they fain would not that the will which lead to our   church is good a well a theirs who have received and are held by the   mystery of theirs or they must suppose two evil nature and two evil   soul conflicting in one man and it will not be true which they say   that there is one good and another bad or they must be converted to the   truth and no more deny that where one deliberates one soul fluctuates   between contrary will     Let them no more say then when they perceive two conflicting will   in one man that the conflict is between two contrary soul of two   contrary substance from two contrary principle one good and the   other bad For Thou O true God dost disprove check and convict them   a when both will being bad one deliberates whether he should kill   a man by poison or by the sword whether he should seize this or that   estate of anothers when he can not both whether he should purchase   pleasure by luxury or keep his money by covetousness whether he go to   the circus or the theatre if both be open on one day or thirdly to   rob anothers house if he have the opportunity or fourthly to commit   adultery if at the same time he have the mean thereof also all these   meeting together in the same juncture of time and all being equally   desired which can not at one time be acted for they rend the mind   amid four or even amid the vast variety of thing desired more   conflicting will nor do they yet allege that there are so many diver   substance So also in will which are good For I ask them is it good   to take pleasure in reading the Apostle or good to take pleasure in   a sober Psalm or good to discourse on the Gospel They will answer to   each it is good What then if all give equal pleasure and all at   once Do not diver will distract the mind while he deliberates which   he should rather choose yet are they all good and are at variance till   one be chosen whither the one entire will may be borne which before   wa divided into many Thus also when above eternity delight u and   the pleasure of temporal good hold u down below it is the same soul   which willeth not this or that with an entire will and therefore is   rent asunder with grievous perplexity while out of truth it set this   first but out of habit set not that aside     Thus soulsick wa I and tormented accusing myself much more severely   than my wo nt rolling and turning me in my chain till that were wholly   broken whereby I now wa but just but still wa held And Thou O   Lord pressedst upon me in my inward part by a severe mercy redoubling   the lash of fear and shame lest I should again give way and not   bursting that same slight remaining tie it should recover strength and   bind me the faster For I said with myself Be it done now be it done   now And a I spake I all but enacted it I all but did it and did   it not yet sunk not back to my former state but kept my stand hard by   and took breath And I essayed again and wanted somewhat le of it   and somewhat le and all but touched and laid hold of it and yet   came not at it nor touched nor laid hold of it hesitating to die to   death and to live to life and the worse whereto I wa inured prevailed   more with me than the better whereto I wa unused and the very moment   wherein I wa to become other than I wa the nearer it approached me   the greater horror did it strike into me yet did it not strike me back   nor turned me away but held me in suspense     The very toy of toy and vanity of vanity my ancient mistress   still held me they plucked my fleshy garment and whispered softly   Dost thou cast u off and from that moment shall we no more be with   thee for ever and from that moment shall not this or that be lawful   for thee for ever And what wa it which they suggested in that I said   this or that what did they suggest O my God Let Thy mercy turn it   away from the soul of Thy servant What defilement did they suggest   what shame And now I much le than half heard them and not openly   showing themselves and contradicting me but muttering a it were behind   my back and privily plucking me a I wa departing but to look back   on them Yet they did retard me so that I hesitated to burst and   shake myself free from them and to spring over whither I wa called   a violent habit saying to me Thinkest thou thou canst live without   them     But now it spake very faintly For on that side whither I had set my   face and whither I trembled to go there appeared unto me the chaste   dignity of Continency serene yet not relaxedly gay honestly alluring   me to come and doubt not and stretching forth to receive and embrace   me her holy hand full of multitude of good example there were so   many young men and maiden here a multitude of youth and every age   grave widow and aged virgin and Continence herself in all not   barren but a fruitful mother of child of joy by Thee her Husband   O Lord And she smiled on me with a persuasive mockery a would she   say Canst not thou what these youth what these maiden can or can   they either in themselves and not rather in the Lord their God The   Lord their God gave me unto them Why standest thou in thyself and   so standest not cast thyself upon Him fear not He will not withdraw   Himself that thou shouldest fall cast thyself fearlessly upon Him He   will receive and will heal thee And I blushed exceedingly for that   I yet heard the muttering of those toy and hung in suspense And she   again seemed to say Stop thine ear against those thy unclean member   on the earth that they may be mortified They tell thee of delight   but not a doth the law of the Lord thy God This controversy in my   heart wa self against self only But Alypius sitting close by my side   in silence waited the issue of my unwonted emotion     But when a deep consideration had from the secret bottom of my soul   drawn together and heaped up all my misery in the sight of my heart   there arose a mighty storm bringing a mighty shower of tear Which   that I might pour forth wholly in it natural expression I rose from   Alypius solitude wa suggested to me a fitter for the business of   weeping so I retired so far that even his presence could not be a   burden to me Thus wa it then with me and he perceived something of   it for something I suppose I had spoken wherein the tone of my voice   appeared choked with weeping and so had risen up He then remained   where we were sitting most extremely astonished I cast myself down I   know not how under a certain figtree giving full vent to my tear   and the flood of mine eye gushed out an acceptable sacrifice to Thee   And not indeed in these word yet to this purpose spake I much unto   Thee and Thou O Lord how long how long Lord wilt Thou be angry for   ever Remember not our former iniquity for I felt that I wa held by   them I sent up these sorrowful word How long how long tomorrow   and tomorrow Why not now why not is there this hour an end to my   uncleanness     So wa I speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my heart   when lo I heard from a neighbouring house a voice a of boy or girl   I know not chanting and oft repeating Take up and read Take up and   read Instantly my countenance altered I began to think most intently   whether child were wo nt in any kind of play to sing such word nor   could I remember ever to have heard the like So checking the torrent   of my tear I arose interpreting it to be no other than a command from   God to open the book and read the first chapter I should find For I   had heard of Antony that coming in during the reading of the Gospel   he received the admonition a if what wa being read wa spoken to him   Go sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have   treasure in heaven and come and follow me and by such oracle he wa   forthwith converted unto Thee Eagerly then I returned to the place   where Alypius wa sitting for there had I laid the volume of the   Apostle when I arose thence I seized opened and in silence read that   section on which my eye first fell Not in rioting and drunkenness not   in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying but put ye   on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh in   concupiscence No further would I read nor needed I for instantly at   the end of this sentence by a light a it were of serenity infused into   my heart all the darkness of doubt vanished away     Then putting my finger between or some other mark I shut the volume   and with a calmed countenance made it known to Alypius And what wa   wrought in him which I knew not he thus showed me He asked to see   what I had read I showed him and he looked even further than I had   read and I knew not what followed This followed him that is weak in   the faith receive which he applied to himself and disclosed to me   And by this admonition wa he strengthened and by a good resolution and   purpose and most corresponding to his character wherein he did always   very far differ from me for the better without any turbulent delay he   joined me Thence we go in to my mother we tell her she rejoiceth we   relate in order how it took place she leap for joy and triumpheth   and blesseth Thee Who are able to do above that which we ask or think   for she perceived that Thou hadst given her more for me than she   wa wo nt to beg by her pitiful and most sorrowful groanings For thou   convertedst me unto Thyself so that I sought neither wife nor any hope   of this world standing in that rule of faith where Thou hadst showed   me unto her in a vision so many year before And Thou didst convert   her mourning into joy much more plentiful than she had desired and   in a much more precious and purer way than she erst required by having   grandchild of my body           BOOK IX       O Lord I am Thy servant I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaid   Thou hast broken my bond in sunder I will offer to Thee the sacrifice   of praise Let my heart and my tongue praise Thee yea let all my bone   say O Lord who is like unto Thee Let them say and answer Thou me   and say unto my soul I am thy salvation Who am I and what am I What   evil have not been either my deed or if not my deed my word or if   not my word my will But Thou O Lord are good and merciful and Thy   right hand had respect unto the depth of my death and from the bottom   of my heart emptied that abyss of corruption And this Thy whole gift   wa to nill what I willed and to will what Thou willedst But where   through all those year and out of what low and deep recess wa my   freewill called forth in a moment whereby to submit my neck to Thy   easy yoke and my shoulder unto Thy light burden O Christ Jesus my   Helper and my Redeemer How sweet did it at once become to me to want   the sweetness of those toy and what I feared to be parted from wa   now a joy to part with For Thou didst cast them forth from me Thou   true and highest sweetness Thou castest them forth and for them   enteredst in Thyself sweeter than all pleasure though not to flesh and   blood brighter than all light but more hidden than all depth higher   than all honour but not to the high in their own conceit Now wa my   soul free from the biting care of canvassing and getting and weltering   in filth and scratching off the itch of lust And my infant tongue   spake freely to Thee my brightness and my rich and my health the   Lord my God     And I resolved in Thy sight not tumultuously to tear but gently to   withdraw the service of my tongue from the mart of liplabour that   the young no student in Thy law nor in Thy peace but in lying   dotage and lawskirmishes should no longer buy at my mouth arm for   their madness And very seasonably it now wanted but very few day unto   the Vacation of the Vintage and I resolved to endure them then in a   regular way to take my leave and having been purchased by Thee no   more to return for sale Our purpose then wa known to Thee but to men   other than our own friend wa it not known For we had agreed among   ourselves not to let it out abroad to any although to u now ascending   from the valley of tear and singing that song of degree Thou hadst   given sharp arrow and destroying coal against the subtle tongue   which a though advising for u would thwart and would out of love   devour u a it doth it meat     Thou hadst pierced our heart with Thy charity and we carried Thy word   a it were fixed in our entrails and the example of Thy servant   whom for black Thou hadst made bright and for dead alive being piled   together in the receptacle of our thought kindled and burned up that   our heavy torpor that we should not sink down to the abyss and they   fired u so vehemently that all the blast of subtle tongue from   gainsayers might only inflame u the more fiercely not extinguish   u Nevertheless because for Thy Names sake which Thou hast hallowed   throughout the earth this our vow and purpose might also find some to   commend it it seemed like ostentation not to wait for the vacation now   so near but to quit beforehand a public profession which wa before   the eye of all so that all looking on this act of mine and observing   how near wa the time of vintage which I wished to anticipate would   talk much of me a if I had desired to appear some great one And what   end had it served me that people should repute and dispute upon my   purpose and that our good should be evil spoken of     Moreover it had at first troubled me that in this very summer my lung   began to give way amid too great literary labour and to breathe deeply   with difficulty and by the pain in my chest to show that they were   injured and to refuse any full or lengthened speaking this had   troubled me for it almost constrained me of necessity to lay down that   burden of teaching or if I could be cured and recover at least to   intermit it But when the full wish for leisure that I might see   how that Thou art the Lord arose and wa fixed in me my God Thou   knowest I began even to rejoice that I had this secondary and that   no feigned excuse which might something moderate the offence taken by   those who for their son sake wished me never to have the freedom of   Thy son Full then of such joy I endured till that interval of time   were run it may have been some twenty day yet they were endured   manfully endured for the covetousness which aforetime bore a part of   this heavy business had left me and I remained alone and had been   overwhelmed had not patience taken it place Perchance some of Thy   servant my brother may say that I sinned in this that with a heart   fully set on Thy service I suffered myself to sit even one hour in the   chair of lie Nor would I be contentious But hast not Thou O most   merciful Lord pardoned and remitted this sin also with my other most   horrible and deadly sin in the holy water     Verecundus wa worn down with care about this our blessedness for that   being held back by bond whereby he wa most straitly bound he saw   that he should be severed from u For himself wa not yet a Christian   his wife one of the faithful and yet hereby more rigidly than by any   other chain wa he let and hindered from the journey which we had now   essayed For he would not he said be a Christian on any other term   than on those he could not However he offered u courteously to remain   at his countryhouse so long a we should stay there Thou O Lord   shalt reward him in the resurrection of the just seeing Thou hast   already given him the lot of the righteous For although in our   absence being now at Rome he wa seized with bodily sickness and   therein being made a Christian and one of the faithful he departed   this life yet hadst Thou mercy not on him only but on u also lest   remembering the exceeding kindness of our friend towards u yet unable   to number him among Thy flock we should be agonised with intolerable   sorrow Thanks unto Thee our God we are Thine Thy suggestion   and consolation tell u Faithful in promise Thou now requitest   Verecundus for his countryhouse of Cassiacum where from the fever   of the world we reposed in Thee with the eternal freshness of Thy   Paradise for that Thou hast forgiven him his sin upon earth in that   rich mountain that mountain which yieldeth milk Thine own mountain     He then had at that time sorrow but Nebridius joy For although he   also not being yet a Christian had fallen into the pit of that most   pernicious error believing the flesh of Thy Son to be a phantom yet   emerging thence he believed a we did not a yet endued with any   Sacraments of Thy Church but a most ardent searcher out of truth Whom   not long after our conversion and regeneration by Thy Baptism being   also a faithful member of the Church Catholic and serving Thee in   perfect chastity and continence amongst his people in Africa his whole   house having through him first been made Christian didst Thou release   from the flesh and now he life in Abrahams bosom Whatever that be   which is signified by that bosom there life my Nebridius my sweet   friend and Thy child O Lord adopted of a freed man there he liveth   For what other place is there for such a soul There he liveth whereof   he asked much of me a poor inexperienced man Now lay he not his ear   to my mouth but his spiritual mouth unto Thy fountain and drinketh a   much a he can receive wisdom in proportion to his thirst endlessly   happy Nor do I think that he is so inebriated therewith a to forget   me seeing Thou Lord Whom he drinketh art mindful of u So were   we then comforting Verecundus who sorrowed a far a friendship   permitted that our conversion wa of such sort and exhorting him to   become faithful according to his measure namely of a married estate   and awaiting Nebridius to follow u which being so near he wa all   but doing and so lo those day rolled by at length for long and many   they seemed for the love I bare to the easeful liberty that I might   sing to Thee from my inmost marrow My heart hath said unto Thee I   have sought Thy face Thy face Lord will I seek     Now wa the day come wherein I wa in deed to be freed of my Rhetoric   Professorship whereof in thought I wa already freed And it wa done   Thou didst rescue my tongue whence Thou hadst before rescued my heart   And I blessed Thee rejoicing retiring with all mine to the villa What   I there did in writing which wa now enlisted in Thy service though   still in this breathingtime a it were panting from the school of   pride my book may witness a well what I debated with others a what   with myself alone before Thee what with Nebridius who wa absent my   Epistles bear witness And when shall I have time to rehearse all Thy   great benefit towards u at that time especially when hasting on to   yet greater mercy For my remembrance recall me and pleasant is it   to me O Lord to confess to Thee by what inward goad Thou tamedst me   and how Thou hast evened me lowering the mountain and hill of my high   imagination straightening my crookedness and smoothing my rough way   and how Thou also subduedst the brother of my heart Alypius unto the   name of Thy Only Begotten our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ which   he would not at first vouchsafe to have inserted in our writing For   rather would he have them savour of the lofty cedar of the Schools   which the Lord hath now broken down than of the wholesome herb of the   Church the antidote against serpent     Oh in what accent spake I unto Thee my God when I read the Psalms of   David those faithful song and sound of devotion which allow of no   swelling spirit a yet a Catechumen and a novice in Thy real love   resting in that villa with Alypius a Catechumen my mother cleaving to   u in female garb with masculine faith with the tranquillity of age   motherly love Christian piety Oh what accent did I utter unto Thee   in those Psalms and how wa I by them kindled towards Thee and on   fire to rehearse them if possible through the whole world against the   pride of mankind And yet they are sung through the whole world nor can   any hide himself from Thy heat With what vehement and bitter sorrow wa   I angered at the Manichees and again I pitied them for they knew not   those Sacraments those medicine and were mad against the antidote   which might have recovered them of their madness How I would they   had then been somewhere near me and without my knowing that they were   there could have beheld my countenance and heard my word when I read   the fourth Psalm in that time of my rest and how that Psalm wrought   upon me When I called the God of my righteousness heard me in   tribulation Thou enlargedst me Have mercy upon me O Lord and hear   my prayer Would that what I uttered on these word they could hear   without my knowing whether they heard lest they should think I spake   it for their sake Because in truth neither should I speak the same   thing nor in the same way if I perceived that they heard and saw me   nor if I spake them would they so receive them a when I spake by and   for myself before Thee out of the natural feeling of my soul     I trembled for fear and again kindled with hope and with rejoicing in   Thy mercy O Father and all issued forth both by mine eye and voice   when Thy good Spirit turning unto u said O ye son of men how long   slow of heart why do ye love vanity and seek after leasing For I had   loved vanity and sought after leasing And Thou O Lord hadst already   magnified Thy Holy One raising Him from the dead and setting Him at   Thy right hand whence from on high He should send His promise the   Comforter the Spirit of truth And He had already sent Him but I knew   it not He had sent Him because He wa now magnified rising again from   the dead and ascending into heaven For till then the Spirit wa not   yet given because Jesus wa not yet glorified And the prophet cry   out How long slow of heart why do ye love vanity and seek after   leasing Know this that the Lord hath magnified His Holy One He cry   out How long He cry out Know this and I so long not knowing   loved vanity and sought after leasing and therefore I heard and   trembled because it wa spoken unto such a I remembered myself to   have been For in those phantom which I had held for truth wa   there vanity and leasing and I spake aloud many thing earnestly and   forcibly in the bitterness of my remembrance Which would they had   heard who yet love vanity and seek after leasing They would perchance   have been troubled and have vomited it up and Thou wouldest hear them   when they cried unto Thee for by a true death in the flesh did He die   for u who now intercedeth unto Thee for u     I further read Be angry and sin not And how wa I moved O my God   who had now learned to be angry at myself for thing past that I might   not sin in time to come Yea to be justly angry for that it wa not   another nature of a people of darkness which sinned for me a they say   who are not angry at themselves and treasure up wrath against the day   of wrath and of the revelation of Thy just judgment Nor were my good   thing now without nor sought with the eye of flesh in that earthly   sun for they that would have joy from without soon become vain and   waste themselves on the thing seen and temporal and in their famished   thought do lick their very shadow Oh that they were wearied out with   their famine and said Who will show u good thing And we would say   and they hear The light of Thy countenance is sealed upon u For we   are not that light which enlighteneth every man but we are enlightened   by Thee that having been sometimes darkness we may be light in Thee   Oh that they could see the eternal Internal which having tasted I wa   grieved that I could not show It them so long a they brought me their   heart in their eye roving abroad from Thee while they said Who will   show u good thing For there where I wa angry within myself in my   chamber where I wa inwardly pricked where I had sacrificed slaying   my old man and commencing the purpose of a new life putting my trust   in Theethere hadst Thou begun to grow sweet unto me and hadst put   gladness in my heart And I cried out a I read this outwardly finding   it inwardly Nor would I be multiplied with worldly good wasting away   time and wasted by time whereas I had in Thy eternal Simple Essence   other corn and wine and oil     And with a loud cry of my heart I cried out in the next verse O in   peace O for The Selfsame O what said he I will lay me down and   sleep for who shall hinder u when cometh to pas that saying which is   written Death is swallowed up in victory And Thou surpassingly art the   Selfsame Who art not changed and in Thee is rest which forgetteth all   toil for there is none other with Thee nor are we to seek those many   other thing which are not what Thou art but Thou Lord alone hast   made me dwell in hope I read and kindled nor found I what to do to   those deaf and dead of whom myself had been a pestilent person a   bitter and a blind bawler against those writing which are honied   with the honey of heaven and lightsome with Thine own light and I wa   consumed with zeal at the enemy of this Scripture     When shall I recall all which passed in those holydays Yet neither   have I forgotten nor will I pas over the severity of Thy scourge and   the wonderful swiftness of Thy mercy Thou didst then torment me with   pain in my teeth which when it had come to such height that I could not   speak it came into my heart to desire all my friend present to pray   for me to Thee the God of all manner of health And this I wrote on   wax and gave it them to read Presently so soon a with humble devotion   we had bowed our knee that pain went away But what pain or how went   it away I wa affrighted O my Lord my God for from infancy I had   never experienced the like And the power of Thy Nod wa deeply conveyed   to me and rejoicing in faith I praised Thy Name And that faith   suffered me not to be at ease about my past sin which were not yet   forgiven me by Thy baptism     The vintagevacation ended I gave notice to the Milanese to provide   their scholar with another master to sell word to them for that I had   both made choice to serve Thee and through my difficulty of breathing   and pain in my chest wa not equal to the Professorship And by letter   I signified to Thy Prelate the holy man Ambrose my former error and   present desire begging his advice what of Thy Scriptures I had best   read to become readier and fitter for receiving so great grace He   recommended Isaiah the Prophet I believe because he above the rest   is a more clear foreshower of the Gospel and of the calling of the   Gentiles But I not understanding the first lesson in him and   imagining the whole to be like it laid it by to be resumed when better   practised in our Lords own word     Thence when the time wa come wherein I wa to give in my name we left   the country and returned to Milan It pleased Alypius also to be with   me born again in Thee being already clothed with the humility befitting   Thy Sacraments and a most valiant tamer of the body so a with   unwonted venture to wear the frozen ground of Italy with his bare foot   We joined with u the boy Adeodatus born after the flesh of my sin   Excellently hadst Thou made him He wa not quite fifteen and in wit   surpassed many grave and learned men I confess unto Thee Thy gift   O Lord my God Creator of all and abundantly able to reform our   deformity for I had no part in that boy but the sin For that we   brought him up in Thy discipline it wa Thou none else had inspired   u with it I confess unto Thee Thy gift There is a book of ours   entitled The Master it is a dialogue between him and me Thou knowest   that all there ascribed to the person conversing with me were his idea   in his sixteenth year Much besides and yet more admirable I found   in him That talent struck awe into me And who but Thou could be the   workmaster of such wonder Soon didst Thou take his life from the   earth and I now remember him without anxiety fearing nothing for   his childhood or youth or his whole self Him we joined with u our   contemporary in grace to be brought up in Thy discipline and we were   baptised and anxiety for our past life vanished from u Nor wa I   sated in those day with the wondrous sweetness of considering the depth   of Thy counsel concerning the salvation of mankind How did I weep   in Thy Hymns and Canticles touched to the quick by the voice of Thy   sweetattuned Church The voice flowed into mine ear and the   Truth distilled into my heart whence the affection of my devotion   overflowed and tear ran down and happy wa I therein     Not long had the Church of Milan begun to use this kind of consolation   and exhortation the brother zealously joining with harmony of voice   and heart For it wa a year or not much more that Justina mother   to the Emperor Valentinian a child persecuted Thy servant Ambrose in   favour of her heresy to which she wa seduced by the Arians The devout   people kept watch in the Church ready to die with their Bishop Thy   servant There my mother Thy handmaid bearing a chief part of those   anxiety and watching lived for prayer We yet unwarmed by the heat   of Thy Spirit still were stirred up by the sight of the amazed and   disquieted city Then it wa first instituted that after the manner of   the Eastern Churches Hymns and Psalms should be sung lest the people   should wax faint through the tediousness of sorrow and from that day to   this the custom is retained diver yea almost all Thy congregation   throughout other part of the world following herein     Then didst Thou by a vision discover to Thy forenamed Bishop where the   body of Gervasius and Protasius the martyr lay hid whom Thou hadst   in Thy secret treasury stored uncorrupted so many year whence Thou   mightest seasonably produce them to repress the fury of a woman but an   Empress For when they were discovered and dug up and with due honour   translated to the Ambrosian Basilica not only they who were vexed with   unclean spirit the devil confessing themselves were cured but a   certain man who had for many year been blind a citizen and well known   to the city asking and hearing the reason of the people confused joy   sprang forth desiring his guide to lead him thither Led thither he   begged to be allowed to touch with his handkerchief the bier of Thy   saint whose death is precious in Thy sight Which when he had done   and put to his eye they were forthwith opened Thence did the fame   spread thence Thy praise glowed shone thence the mind of that enemy   though not turned to the soundness of believing wa yet turned back   from her fury of persecuting Thanks to Thee O my God Whence and   whither hast Thou thus led my remembrance that I should confess these   thing also unto Thee which great though they be I had passed by in   forgetfulness And yet then when the odour of Thy ointment wa so   fragrant did we not run after Thee Therefore did I more weep among   the singing of Thy Hymns formerly sighing after Thee and at length   breathing in Thee a far a the breath may enter into this our house of   grass     Thou that makest men to dwell of one mind in one house didst join with   u Euodius also a young man of our own city Who being an officer of   Court wa before u converted to Thee and baptised and quitting his   secular warfare girded himself to Thine We were together about to   dwell together in our devout purpose We sought where we might serve   Thee most usefully and were together returning to Africa whitherward   being a far a Ostia my mother departed this life Much I omit a   hastening much Receive my confession and thanksgiving O my God for   innumerable thing whereof I am silent But I will not omit whatsoever   my soul would bring forth concerning that Thy handmaid who brought me   forth both in the flesh that I might be born to this temporal light   and in heart that I might be born to Light eternal Not her gift but   Thine in her would I speak of for neither did she make nor educate   herself Thou createdst her nor did her father and mother know what a   one should come from them And the sceptre of Thy Christ the discipline   of Thine only Son in a Christian house a good member of Thy Church   educated her in Thy fear Yet for her good discipline wa she wo nt   to commend not so much her mother diligence a that of a certain   decrepit maidservant who had carried her father when a child a   little one used to be carried at the back of elder girl For which   reason and for her great age and excellent conversation wa she   in that Christian family well respected by it head Whence also the   charge of her master daughter wa entrusted to her to which she gave   diligent heed restraining them earnestly when necessary with a holy   severity and teaching them with a grave discretion For except at   those hour wherein they were most temporately fed at their parent   table she would not suffer them though parched with thirst to drink   even water preventing an evil custom and adding this wholesome advice   Ye drink water now because you have not wine in your power but when   you come to be married and be made mistress of cellar and cupboard   you will scorn water but the custom of drinking will abide By this   method of instruction and the authority she had she refrained the   greediness of childhood and moulded their very thirst to such an   excellent moderation that what they should not that they would not     And yet a Thy handmaid told me her son there had crept upon her   a love of wine For when a the manner wa she a though a sober   maiden wa bidden by her parent to draw wine out of the hogshed   holding the vessel under the opening before she poured the wine into   the flagon she sipped a little with the tip of her lip for more her   instinctive feeling refused For this she did not out of any desire   of drink but out of the exuberance of youth whereby it boil over in   mirthful freak which in youthful spirit are wo nt to be kept under by   the gravity of their elder And thus by adding to that little daily   little for whoso despiseth little thing shall fall by little and   little she had fallen into such a habit a greedily to drink off her   little cup brimfull almost of wine Where wa then that discreet old   woman and that her earnest countermanding Would aught avail against   a secret disease if Thy healing hand O Lord watched not over u   Father mother and governor absent Thou present who createdst who   callest who also by those set over u workest something towards the   salvation of our soul what didst Thou then O my God how didst Thou   cure her how heal her didst Thou not out of another soul bring forth a   hard and a sharp taunt like a lancet out of Thy secret store and with   one touch remove all that foul stuff For a maidservant with whom she   used to go to the cellar falling to word a it happens with her   little mistress when alone with her taunted her with this fault with   most bitter insult calling her winebibber With which taunt she stung   to the quick saw the foulness of her fault and instantly condemned and   forsook it As flattering friend pervert so reproachful enemy mostly   correct Yet not what by them Thou doest but what themselves purposed   dost Thou repay them For she in her anger sought to vex her young   mistress not to amend her and did it in private either for that the   time and place of the quarrel so found them or lest herself also should   have anger for discovering it thus late But Thou Lord Governor   of all in heaven and earth who turnest to Thy purpose the deepest   current and the ruled turbulence of the tide of time didst by the   very unhealthiness of one soul heal another lest any when he observes   this should ascribe it to his own power even when another whom he   wished to be reformed is reformed through word of his     Brought up thus modestly and soberly and made subject rather by Thee   to her parent than by her parent to Thee so soon a she wa of   marriageable age being bestowed upon a husband she served him a her   lord and did her diligence to win him unto Thee preaching Thee unto   him by her conversation by which Thou ornamentedst her making her   reverently amiable and admirable unto her husband And she so endured   the wronging of her bed a never to have any quarrel with her husband   thereon For she looked for Thy mercy upon him that believing in Thee   he might be made chaste But besides this he wa fervid a in his   affection so in anger but she had learnt not to resist an angry   husband not in deed only but not even in word Only when he wa   smoothed and tranquil and in a temper to receive it she would give an   account of her action if haply he had overhastily taken offence In   a word while many matron who had milder husband yet bore even in   their face mark of shame would in familiar talk blame their husband   life she would blame their tongue giving them a in jest earnest   advice That from the time they heard the marriage writing read to   them they should account them a indenture whereby they were   made servant and so remembering their condition ought not to set   themselves up against their lord And when they knowing what a   choleric husband she endured marvelled that it had never been heard   nor by any token perceived that Patricius had beaten his wife or that   there had been any domestic difference between them even for one day   and confidentially asking the reason she taught them her practice above   mentioned Those wife who observed it found the good and returned   thanks those who observed it not found no relief and suffered     Her motherinlaw also at first by whispering of evil servant   incensed against her she so overcame by observance and persevering   endurance and meekness that she of her own accord discovered to her   son the meddling tongue whereby the domestic peace betwixt her and her   daughterinlaw had been disturbed asking him to correct them Then   when in compliance with his mother and for the wellordering of the   family he had with stripe corrected those discovered at her will who   had discovered them she promised the like reward to any who to please   her should speak ill of her daughterinlaw to her and none now   venturing they lived together with a remarkable sweetness of mutual   kindness     This great gift also thou bestowedst O my God my mercy upon that good   handmaid of Thine in whose womb Thou createdst me that between any   disagreeing and discordant party where she wa able she showed   herself such a peacemaker that hearing on both side most bitter   thing such a swelling and indigested choler us to break out into   when the crudity of enmity are breathed out in sour discourse to a   present friend against an absent enemy she never would disclose aught   of the one unto the other but what might tend to their reconcilement   A small good this might appear to me did I not to my grief know   numberless person who through some horrible and widespreading   contagion of sin not only disclose to person mutually angered thing   said in anger but add withal thing never spoken whereas to humane   humanity it ought to seem a light thing not to torment or increase ill   will by ill word unless one study withal by good word to quench it   Such wa she Thyself her most inward Instructor teaching her in the   school of the heart     Finally her own husband towards the very end of his earthly life   did she gain unto Thee nor had she to complain of that in him a a   believer which before he wa a believer she had borne from him She wa   also the servant of Thy servant whosoever of them knew her did in her   much praise and honour and love Thee for that through the witness of   the fruit of a holy conversation they perceived Thy presence in her   heart For she had been the wife of one man had requited her parent   had governed her house piously wa well reported of for good work had   brought up child so often travailing in birth of them a she saw   them swerving from Thee Lastly of all of u Thy servant O Lord whom   on occasion of Thy own gift Thou sufferest to speak u who before her   sleeping in Thee lived united together having received the grace of Thy   baptism did she so take care of a though she had been mother of u   all so served u a though she had been child to u all     The day now approaching whereon she wa to depart this life which day   Thou well knewest we knew not it came to pas Thyself a I believe   by Thy secret way so ordering it that she and I stood alone leaning   in a certain window which looked into the garden of the house where we   now lay at Ostia where removed from the din of men we were recruiting   from the fatigue of a long journey for the voyage We were discoursing   then together alone very sweetly and forgetting those thing which   are behind and reaching forth unto those thing which are before we   were enquiring between ourselves in the presence of the Truth which   Thou art of what sort the eternal life of the saint wa to be which   eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of   man But yet we gasped with the mouth of our heart after those heavenly   stream of Thy fountain the fountain of life which is with Thee that   being bedewed thence according to our capacity we might in some sort   meditate upon so high a mystery     And when our discourse wa brought to that point that the very highest   delight of the earthly sens in the very purest material light   wa in respect of the sweetness of that life not only not worthy of   comparison but not even of mention we raising up ourselves with a more   glowing affection towards the Selfsame did by degree pas through   all thing bodily even the very heaven whence sun and moon and star   shine upon the earth yea we were soaring higher yet by inward musing   and discourse and admiring of Thy work and we came to our own   mind and went beyond them that we might arrive at that region of   neverfailing plenty where Thou feedest Israel for ever with the food   of truth and where life is the Wisdom by whom all these thing are   made and what have been and what shall be and she is not made but   is a she hath been and so shall she be ever yea rather to have   been and hereafter to be are not in her but only to be seeing   she is eternal For to have been and to be hereafter are not   eternal And while we were discoursing and panting after her we   slightly touched on her with the whole effort of our heart and we   sighed and there we leave bound the first fruit of the Spirit and   returned to vocal expression of our mouth where the word spoken   ha beginning and end And what is like unto Thy Word our Lord who   endureth in Himself without becoming old and maketh all thing new     We were saying then If to any the tumult of the flesh were hushed   hushed the image of earth and water and air hushed also the pole of   heaven yea the very soul be hushed to herself and by not thinking on   self surmount self hushed all dream and imaginary revelation every   tongue and every sign and whatsoever exists only in transition since   if any could hear all these say We made not ourselves but He made u   that abideth for everIf then having uttered this they too should be   hushed having roused only our ear to Him who made them and He alone   speak not by them but by Himself that we may hear His Word not   through any tongue of flesh nor Angels voice nor sound of thunder   nor in the dark riddle of a similitude but might hear Whom in these   thing we love might hear His Very Self without these a we two now   strained ourselves and in swift thought touched on that Eternal Wisdom   which abideth over allcould this be continued on and other vision   of kind far unlike be withdrawn and this one ravish and absorb and   wrap up it beholder amid these inward joy so that life might be for   ever like that one moment of understanding which now we sighed after   were not this Enter into thy Masters joy And when shall that be When   we shall all rise again though we shall not all be changed     Such thing wa I speaking and even if not in this very manner and   these same word yet Lord Thou knowest that in that day when we were   speaking of these thing and this world with all it delight became   a we spake contemptible to u my mother said Son for mine own part   I have no further delight in any thing in this life What I do here any   longer and to what I am here I know not now that my hope in this   world are accomplished One thing there wa for which I desired to   linger for a while in this life that I might see thee a Catholic   Christian before I died My God hath done this for me more abundantly   that I should now see thee withal despising earthly happiness become   His servant what do I here     What answer I made her unto these thing I remember not For scarce   five day after or not much more she fell sick of a fever and in that   sickness one day she fell into a swoon and wa for a while withdrawn   from these visible thing We hastened round her but she wa soon   brought back to her sens and looking on me and my brother standing by   her said to u enquiringly Where wa I And then looking fixedly on   u with grief amazed Here saith she shall you bury your mother   I held my peace and refrained weeping but my brother spake something   wishing for her a the happier lot that she might die not in a   strange place but in her own land Whereat she with anxious look   checking him with her eye for that he still savoured such thing and   then looking upon me Behold saith she what he saith and soon   after to u both Lay she saith this body any where let not the   care for that any way disquiet you this only I request that you would   remember me at the Lords altar wherever you be And having delivered   this sentiment in what word she could she held her peace being   exercised by her growing sickness     But I considering Thy gift Thou unseen God which Thou instillest   into the heart of Thy faithful one whence wondrous fruit do spring   did rejoice and give thanks to Thee recalling what I before knew how   careful and anxious she had ever been a to her place of burial which   she had provided and prepared for herself by the body of her husband   For because they had lived in great harmony together she also wished   so little can the human mind embrace thing divine to have this   addition to that happiness and to have it remembered among men that   after her pilgrimage beyond the sea what wa earthly of this united   pair had been permitted to be united beneath the same earth But when   this emptiness had through the fulness of Thy goodness begun to cease in   her heart I knew not and rejoiced admiring what she had so disclosed   to me though indeed in that our discourse also in the window when she   said What do I here any longer there appeared no desire of dying   in her own country I heard afterwards also that when we were now   at Ostia she with a mother confidence when I wa absent one day   discoursed with certain of my friend about the contempt of this life   and the blessing of death and when they were amazed at such courage   which Thou hadst given to a woman and asked Whether she were not   afraid to leave her body so far from her own city she replied   Nothing is far to God nor wa it to be feared lest at the end of the   world He should not recognise whence He were to raise me up On the   ninth day then of her sickness and the fiftysixth year of her age and   the threeandthirtieth of mine wa that religious and holy soul freed   from the body     I closed her eye and there flowed withal a mighty sorrow into my   heart which wa overflowing into tear mine eye at the same time by   the violent command of my mind drank up their fountain wholly dry and   woe wa me in such a strife But when she breathed her last the boy   Adeodatus burst out into a loud lament then checked by u all held   his peace In like manner also a childish feeling in me which wa   through my heart youthful voice finding it vent in weeping wa   checked and silenced For we thought it not fitting to solemnise that   funeral with tearful lament and groanings for thereby do they for   the most part express grief for the departed a though unhappy or   altogether dead whereas she wa neither unhappy in her death nor   altogether dead Of this we were assured on good ground the testimony   of her good conversation and her faith unfeigned     What then wa it which did grievously pain me within but a fresh wound   wrought through the sudden wrench of that most sweet and dear custom of   living together I joyed indeed in her testimony when in that her last   sickness mingling her endearment with my act of duty she called me   dutiful and mentioned with great affection of love that she never   had heard any harsh or reproachful sound uttered by my mouth against   her But yet O my God Who madest u what comparison is there betwixt   that honour that I paid to her and her slavery for me Being then   forsaken of so great comfort in her my soul wa wounded and that life   rent asunder a it were which of hers and mine together had been made   but one     The boy then being stilled from weeping Euodius took up the Psalter   and began to sing our whole house answering him the Psalm I will sing   of mercy and judgment to Thee O Lord But hearing what we were doing   many brother and religious woman came together and whilst they whose   office it wa made ready for the burial a the manner is I in a part   of the house where I might properly together with those who thought   not fit to leave me discoursed upon something fitting the time and by   this balm of truth assuaged that torment known to Thee they unknowing   and listening intently and conceiving me to be without all sense of   sorrow But in Thy ear where none of them heard I blamed the weakness   of my feeling and refrained my flood of grief which gave way a little   unto me but again came a with a tide yet not so a to burst out into   tear nor to change of countenance still I knew what I wa keeping   down in my heart And being very much displeased that these human thing   had such power over me which in the due order and appointment of our   natural condition must need come to pas with a new grief I grieved   for my grief and wa thus worn by a double sorrow     And behold the corpse wa carried to the burial we went and returned   without tear For neither in those prayer which we poured forth unto   Thee when the Sacrifice of our ransom wa offered for her when now the   corpse wa by the graf side a the manner there is previous to it   being laid therein did I weep even during those prayer yet wa I the   whole day in secret heavily sad and with troubled mind prayed Thee a   I could to heal my sorrow yet Thou didst not impressing I believe   upon my memory by this one instance how strong is the bond of all   habit even upon a soul which now feed upon no deceiving Word It   seemed also good to me to go and bathe having heard that the bath had   it name balneum from the Greek Balaneion for that it drive sadness   from the mind And this also I confess unto Thy mercy Father of the   fatherless that I bathed and wa the same a before I bathed For the   bitterness of sorrow could not exude out of my heart Then I slept and   woke up again and found my grief not a little softened and a I wa   alone in my bed I remembered those true verse of Thy Ambrose For Thou   art the              Maker of all the Lord              And Ruler of the height            Who robing day in light hast poured              Soft slumber oer the night            That to our limb the power              Of toil may be renewd            And heart be raisd that sink and cower              And sorrow be subdud     And then by little and little I recovered my former thought of Thy   handmaid her holy conversation towards Thee her holy tenderness and   observance towards u whereof I wa suddenly deprived and I wa minded   to weep in Thy sight for her and for myself in her behalf and in my   own And I gave way to the tear which I before restrained to overflow   a much a they desired reposing my heart upon them and it found rest   in them for it wa in Thy ear not in those of man who would have   scornfully interpreted my weeping And now Lord in writing I confess   it unto Thee Read it who will and interpret it how he will and if   he find sin therein that I wept my mother for a small portion of an   hour the mother who for the time wa dead to mine eye who had for   many year wept for me that I might live in Thine eye let him not   deride me but rather if he be one of large charity let him weep   himself for my sin unto Thee the Father of all the brother of Thy   Christ     But now with a heart cured of that wound wherein it might seem   blameworthy for an earthly feeling I pour out unto Thee our God in   behalf of that Thy handmaid a far different kind of tear flowing from   a spirit shaken by the thought of the danger of every soul that dieth   in Adam And although she having been quickened in Christ even before   her release from the flesh had lived to the praise of Thy name for   her faith and conversation yet dare I not say that from what time Thou   regeneratedst her by baptism no word issued from her mouth against Thy   Commandment Thy Son the Truth hath said Whosoever shall say unto   his brother Thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire And woe be even   unto the commendable life of men if laying aside mercy Thou shouldest   examine it But because Thou art not extreme in enquiring after sin we   confidently hope to find some place with Thee But whosoever reckons up   his real merit to Thee what reckons he up to Thee but Thine own gift   O that men would know themselves to be men and that he that glorieth   would glory in the Lord     I therefore O my Praise and my Life God of my heart laying aside for   a while her good deed for which I give thanks to Thee with joy do now   beseech Thee for the sin of my mother Hearken unto me I entreat Thee   by the Medicine of our wound Who hung upon the tree and now sitting   at Thy right hand maketh intercession to Thee for u I know that she   dealt mercifully and from her heart forgave her debtor their debt do   Thou also forgive her debt whatever she may have contracted in so   many year since the water of salvation Forgive her Lord forgive I   beseech Thee enter not into judgment with her Let Thy mercy be exalted   above Thy justice since Thy word are true and Thou hast promised   mercy unto the merciful which Thou gavest them to be who wilt have   mercy on whom Thou wilt have mercy and wilt have compassion on whom   Thou hast had compassion     And I believe Thou hast already done what I ask but accept O Lord   the freewill offering of my mouth For she the day of her dissolution   now at hand took no thought to have her body sumptuously wound up or   embalmed with spice nor desired she a choice monument or to be buried   in her own land These thing she enjoined u not but desired only to   have her name commemorated at Thy Altar which she had served without   intermission of one day whence she knew the holy Sacrifice to be   dispensed by which the handwriting that wa against u is blotted out   through which the enemy wa triumphed over who summing up our offence   and seeking what to lay to our charge found nothing in Him in Whom we   conquer Who shall restore to Him the innocent blood Who repay Him   the price wherewith He bought u and so take u from Him Unto the   Sacrament of which our ransom Thy handmaid bound her soul by the bond   of faith Let none sever her from Thy protection let neither the lion   nor the dragon interpose himself by force or fraud For she will not   answer that she owes nothing lest she be convicted and seized by the   crafty accuser but she will answer that her sin are forgiven her by   Him to Whom none can repay that price which He Who owed nothing paid   for u     May she rest then in peace with the husband before and after whom she   had never any whom she obeyed with patience bringing forth fruit unto   Thee that she might win him also unto Thee And inspire O Lord my God   inspire Thy servant my brother Thy son my master whom with   voice and heart and pen I serve that so many a shall read these   Confessions may at Thy Altar remember Monnica Thy handmaid with   Patricius her sometimes husband by whose body Thou broughtest me   into this life how I know not May they with devout affection remember   my parent in this transitory light my brother under Thee our Father   in our Catholic Mother and my fellowcitizens in that eternal Jerusalem   which Thy pilgrim people sigheth after from their Exodus even unto   their return thither That so my mother last request of me may   through my confession more than through my prayer be through the   prayer of many more abundantly fulfilled to her           BOOK X       Let me know Thee O Lord who knowest me let me know Thee a I am   known Power of my soul enter into it and fit it for Thee that   Thou mayest have and hold it without spot or wrinkle This is my hope   therefore do I speak and in this hope do I rejoice when I rejoice   healthfully Other thing of this life are the le to be sorrowed for   the more they are sorrowed for and the more to be sorrowed for the   le men sorrow for them For behold Thou lovest the truth and he that   doth it cometh to the light This would I do in my heart before Thee in   confession and in my writing before many witness     And from Thee O Lord unto whose eye the abyss of man conscience is   naked what could be hidden in me though I would not confess it For   I should hide Thee from me not me from Thee But now for that my   groaning is witness that I am displeased with myself Thou shinest out   and art pleasing and beloved and longed for that I may be ashamed of   myself and renounce myself and choose Thee and neither please Thee   nor myself but in Thee To Thee therefore O Lord am I open whatever   I am and with what fruit I confess unto Thee I have said Nor do I it   with word and sound of the flesh but with the word of my soul and   the cry of the thought which Thy ear knoweth For when I am evil then   to confess to Thee is nothing else than to be displeased with myself   but when holy nothing else than not to ascribe it to myself because   Thou O Lord blessest the godly but first Thou justifieth him when   ungodly My confession then O my God in Thy sight is made silently   and not silently For in sound it is silent in affection it cry   aloud For neither do I utter any thing right unto men which Thou hast   not before heard from me nor dost Thou hear any such thing from me   which Thou hast not first said unto me     What then have I to do with men that they should hear my   confessionsas if they could heal all my infirmitiesa race curious   to know the life of others slothful to amend their own Why seek they   to hear from me what I am who will not hear from Thee what themselves   are And how know they when from myself they hear of myself whether   I say true seeing no man know what is in man but the spirit of man   which is in him But if they hear from Thee of themselves they can not   say The Lord lieth For what is it to hear from Thee of themselves   but to know themselves and who knoweth and saith It is false unless   himself lieth But because charity believeth all thing that is among   those whom knitting unto itself it maketh one I also O Lord will   in such wise confess unto Thee that men may hear to whom I can not   demonstrate whether I confess truly yet they believe me whose ear   charity openeth unto me     But do Thou my inmost Physician make plain unto me what fruit I may   reap by doing it For the confession of my past sin which Thou hast   forgiven and covered that Thou mightest bless me in Thee changing my   soul by Faith and Thy Sacrament when read and heard stir up the heart   that it sleep not in despair and say I can not but awake in the love   of Thy mercy and the sweetness of Thy grace whereby whoso is weak is   strong when by it he became conscious of his own weakness And the good   delight to hear of the past evil of such a are now freed from them   not because they are evil but because they have been and are not With   what fruit then O Lord my God to Whom my conscience daily confesseth   trusting more in the hope of Thy mercy than in her own innocency   with what fruit I pray do I by this book confess to men also in Thy   presence what I now am not what I have been For that other fruit I   have seen and spoken of But what I now am at the very time of making   these confession diver desire to know who have or have not known me   who have heard from me or of me but their ear is not at my heart where   I am whatever I am They wish then to hear me confess what I am within   whither neither their eye nor ear nor understanding can reach they   wish it a ready to believebut will they know For charity whereby   they are good telleth them that in my confession I lie not and she in   them believeth me     But for what fruit would they hear this Do they desire to joy with me   when they hear how near by Thy gift I approach unto Thee and to pray   for me when they shall hear how much I am held back by my own weight   To such will I discover myself For it is no mean fruit O Lord my God   that by many thanks should be given to Thee on our behalf and Thou be   by many entreated for u Let the brotherly mind love in me what Thou   teachest is to be loved and lament in me what Thou teachest is to be   lamented Let a brotherly not a stranger mind not that of the strange   child whose mouth talketh of vanity and their right hand is a   right hand of iniquity but that brotherly mind which when it approveth   rejoiceth for me and when it disapproveth me is sorry for me because   whether it approveth or disapproveth it loveth me To such will I   discover myself they will breathe freely at my good deed sigh for my   ill My good deed are Thine appointment and Thy gift my evil one   are my offence and Thy judgment Let them breathe freely at the one   sigh at the other and let hymn and weeping go up into Thy sight   out of the heart of my brother Thy censer And do Thou O Lord   be pleased with the incense of Thy holy temple have mercy upon me   according to Thy great mercy for Thine own name sake and no way   forsaking what Thou hast begun perfect my imperfection     This is the fruit of my confession of what I am not of what I have   been to confess this not before Thee only in a secret exultation with   trembling and a secret sorrow with hope but in the ear also of the   believing son of men sharer of my joy and partner in my mortality   my fellowcitizens and fellowpilgrims who are gone before or are to   follow on companion of my way These are Thy servant my brother   whom Thou willest to be Thy son my master whom Thou commandest me to   serve if I would live with Thee of Thee But this Thy Word were little   did it only command by speaking and not go before in performing This   then I do in deed and word this I do under Thy wing in over great   peril were not my soul subdued unto Thee under Thy wing and my   infirmity known unto Thee I am a little one but my Father ever liveth   and my Guardian is sufficient for me For He is the same who begat me   and defends me and Thou Thyself art all my good Thou Almighty   Who are with me yea before I am with Thee To such then whom Thou   commandest me to serve will I discover not what I have been but what I   now am and what I yet am But neither do I judge myself Thus therefore   I would be heard     For Thou Lord dost judge me because although no man knoweth the   thing of a man but the spirit of a man which is in him yet is there   something of man which neither the spirit of man that is in him itself   knoweth But Thou Lord knowest all of him Who hast made him Yet I   though in Thy sight I despise myself and account myself dust and ash   yet know I something of Thee which I know not of myself And truly   now we see through a glass darkly not face to face a yet So long   therefore a I be absent from Thee I am more present with myself than   with Thee and yet know I Thee that Thou art in no way passible but I   what temptation I can resist what I can not I know not And there is   hope because Thou art faithful Who wilt not suffer u to be tempted   above that we are able but wilt with the temptation also make a way to   escape that we may be able to bear it I will confess then what I   know of myself I will confess also what I know not of myself And that   because what I do know of myself I know by Thy shining upon me and   what I know not of myself so long know I not it until my darkness be   made a the noonday in Thy countenance     Not with doubting but with assured consciousness do I love Thee Lord   Thou hast stricken my heart with Thy word and I loved Thee Yea also   heaven and earth and all that therein is behold on every side they   bid me love Thee nor cease to say so unto all that they may be without   excuse But more deeply wilt Thou have mercy on whom Thou wilt have   mercy and wilt have compassion on whom Thou hast had compassion else   in deaf ear do the heaven and the earth speak Thy praise But what do   I love when I love Thee not beauty of body nor the fair harmony   of time nor the brightness of the light so gladsome to our eye nor   sweet melody of varied song nor the fragrant smell of flower and   ointment and spice not manna and honey not limb acceptable to   embracement of flesh None of these I love when I love my God and   yet I love a kind of light and melody and fragrance and meat and   embracement when I love my God the light melody fragrance meat   embracement of my inner man where there shineth unto my soul what space   can not contain and there soundeth what time beareth not away and there   smelleth what breathing disperseth not and there tasteth what eating   diminisheth not and there clingeth what satiety divorceth not This is   it which I love when I love my God     And what is this I asked the earth and it answered me I am not He   and whatsoever are in it confessed the same I asked the sea and the   deep and the living creeping thing and they answered We are not   thy God seek above u I asked the moving air and the whole air with   his inhabitant answered Anaximenes wa deceived I am not God I   asked the heaven sun moon star Nor say they are we the God whom   thou seekest And I replied unto all the thing which encompass the   door of my flesh Ye have told me of my God that ye are not He tell   me something of Him And they cried out with a loud voice He made   u My questioning them wa my thought on them and their form of   beauty gave the answer And I turned myself unto myself and said to   myself Who art thou And I answered A man And behold in me there   present themselves to me soul and body one without the other within   By which of these ought I to seek my God I had sought Him in the body   from earth to heaven so far a I could send messenger the beam   of mine eye But the better is the inner for to it a presiding and   judging all the bodily messenger reported the answer of heaven and   earth and all thing therein who said We are not God but He made   u These thing did my inner man know by the ministry of the outer I   the inner knew them I the mind through the sens of my body I asked   the whole frame of the world about my God and it answered me I am not   He but He made me     Is not this corporeal figure apparent to all whose sens are perfect   why then speaks it not the same to all Animals small and great see it   but they can not ask it because no reason is set over their sens to   judge on what they report But men can ask so that the invisible thing   of God are clearly seen being understood by the thing that are made   but by love of them they are made subject unto them and subject   can not judge Nor yet do the creature answer such a ask unless they   can judge nor yet do they change their voice ie their appearance   if one man only see another seeing asks so a to appear one way to   this man another way to that but appearing the same way to both it is   dumb to this speaks to that yea rather it speaks to all but they only   understand who compare it voice received from without with the truth   within For truth saith unto me Neither heaven nor earth nor any   other body is thy God This their very nature saith to him that seeth   them They are a mass a mass is le in a part thereof than in the   whole Now to thee I speak O my soul thou art my better part for   thou quickenest the mass of my body giving it life which no body can   give to a body but thy God is even unto thee the Life of thy life     What then do I love when I love my God who is He above the head of   my soul By my very soul will I ascend to Him I will pas beyond that   power whereby I am united to my body and fill it whole frame with   life Nor can I by that power find my God for so horse and mule that   have no understanding might find Him seeing it is the same power   whereby even their body live But another power there is not that   only whereby I animate but that too whereby I imbue with sense my   flesh which the Lord hath framed for me commanding the eye not to   hear and the ear not to see but the eye that through it I should   see and the ear that through it I should hear and to the other sens   severally what is to each their own peculiar seat and office which   being diver I the one mind do through them enact I will pas beyond   this power of mine also for this also have the horse and mule for   they also perceive through the body     I will pas then beyond this power of my nature also rising by degree   unto Him Who made me And I come to the field and spacious palace of   my memory where are the treasure of innumerable image brought into   it from thing of all sort perceived by the sens There is stored up   whatsoever besides we think either by enlarging or diminishing or   any other way varying those thing which the sense hath come to and   whatever else hath been committed and laid up which forgetfulness hath   not yet swallowed up and buried When I enter there I require what I   will to be brought forth and something instantly come others must be   longer sought after which are fetched a it were out of some inner   receptacle others rush out in troop and while one thing is desired   and required they start forth a who should say Is it perchance   I These I drive away with the hand of my heart from the face of my   remembrance until what I wish for be unveiled and appear in sight out   of it secret place Other thing come up readily in unbroken order a   they are called for those in front making way for the following and   a they make way they are hidden from sight ready to come when I will   All which take place when I repeat a thing by heart     There are all thing preserved distinctly and under general head each   having entered by it own avenue a light and all colour and form of   body by the eye by the ear all sort of sound all smell by the   avenue of the nostril all taste by the mouth and by the sensation of   the whole body what is hard or soft hot or cold or rugged heavy or   light either outwardly or inwardly to the body All these doth that   great harbour of the memory receive in her numberless secret and   inexpressible winding to be forthcoming and brought out at need each   entering in by his own gate and there laid up Nor yet do the thing   themselves enter in only the image of the thing perceived are there   in readiness for thought to recall Which image how they are formed   who can tell though it doth plainly appear by which sense each hath   been brought in and stored up For even while I dwell in darkness and   silence in my memory I can produce colour if I will and discern   betwixt black and white and what others I will nor yet do sound break   in and disturb the image drawn in by my eye which I am reviewing   though they also are there lying dormant and laid up a it were   apart For these too I call for and forthwith they appear And though   my tongue be still and my throat mute so can I sing a much a I will   nor do those image of colour which notwithstanding be there intrude   themselves and interrupt when another store is called for which   flowed in by the ear So the other thing piled in and up by the other   sens I recall at my pleasure Yea I discern the breath of lily   from violet though smelling nothing and I prefer honey to sweet wine   smooth before rugged at the time neither tasting nor handling but   remembering only     These thing do I within in that vast court of my memory For there   are present with me heaven earth sea and whatever I could think on   therein besides what I have forgotten There also meet I with myself   and recall myself and when where and what I have done and under what   feeling There be all which I remember either on my own experience   or others credit Out of the same store do I myself with the past   continually combine fresh and fresh likeness of thing which I have   experienced or from what I have experienced have believed and thence   again infer future action event and hope and all these again I   reflect on a present I will do this or that say I to myself in   that great receptacle of my mind stored with the image of thing so   many and so great and this or that will follow O that this or that   might be God avert this or that So speak I to myself and when   I speak the image of all I speak of are present out of the same   treasury of memory nor would I speak of any thereof were the image   wanting     Great is this force of memory excessive great O my God a large and   boundless chamber who ever sounded the bottom thereof yet is this a   power of mine and belongs unto my nature nor do I myself comprehend   all that I am Therefore is the mind too strait to contain itself And   where should that be which it containeth not of itself Is it without   it and not within how then doth it not comprehend itself A wonderful   admiration surprise me amazement seizes me upon this And men go   abroad to admire the height of mountain the mighty billow of the   sea the broad tide of river the compass of the ocean and the   circuit of the star and pas themselves by nor wonder that when I   spake of all these thing I did not see them with mine eye yet could   not have spoken of them unless I then actually saw the mountain   billow river star which I had seen and that ocean which I believe   to be inwardly in my memory and that with the same vast space   between a if I saw them abroad Yet did not I by seeing draw them into   myself when with mine eye I beheld them nor are they themselves with   me but their image only And I know by what sense of the body each wa   impressed upon me     Yet not these alone doe the unmeasurable capacity of my memory retain   Here also is all learnt of the liberal science and a yet unforgotten   removed a it were to some inner place which is yet no place nor   are they the image thereof but the thing themselves For what is   literature what the art of disputing how many kind of question there   be whatsoever of these I know in such manner exists in my memory a   that I have not taken in the image and left out the thing or that it   should have sounded and passed away like a voice fixed on the ear by   that impress whereby it might be recalled a if it sounded when it   no longer sounded or a a smell while it pass and evaporates into air   affect the sense of smell whence it conveys into the memory an image   of itself which remembering we renew or a meat which verily in   the belly hath now no taste and yet in the memory still in a manner   tasteth or a any thing which the body by touch perceiveth and which   when removed from u the memory still conceives For those thing   are not transmitted into the memory but their image only are with   an admirable swiftness caught up and stored a it were in wondrous   cabinet and thence wonderfully by the act of remembering brought   forth     But now when I hear that there be three kind of question Whether the   thing be what it is of what kind it is I do indeed hold the image   of the sound of which those word be composed and that those sound   with a noise passed through the air and now are not But the thing   themselves which are signified by those sound I never reached with any   sense of my body nor ever discerned them otherwise than in my mind yet   in my memory have I laid up not their image but themselves Which how   they entered into me let them say if they can for I have gone over all   the avenue of my flesh but can not find by which they entered For the   eye say If those image were coloured we reported of them The ear   say If they sound we gave knowledge of them The nostril say If   they smell they passed by u The taste say Unless they have a   savour ask me not The touch say If it have not size I handled   it not if I handled it not I gave no notice of it Whence and how   entered these thing into my memory I know not how For when I learned   them I gave not credit to another man mind but recognised them in   mine and approving them for true I commended them to it laying them   up a it were whence I might bring them forth when I willed In my   heart then they were even before I learned them but in my memory   they were not Where then or wherefore when they were spoken did I   acknowledge them and said So is it it is true unless that they   were already in the memory but so thrown back and buried a it were in   deeper recess that had not the suggestion of another drawn them forth   I had perchance been unable to conceive of them     Wherefore we find that to learn these thing whereof we imbibe not the   image by our sens but perceive within by themselves without image   a they are is nothing else but by conception to receive and by   marking to take heed that those thing which the memory did before   contain at random and unarranged be laid up at hand a it were in that   same memory where before they lay unknown scattered and neglected and   so readily occur to the mind familiarised to them And how many thing   of this kind doe my memory bear which have been already found out and   a I said placed a it were at hand which we are said to have learned   and come to know which were I for some short space of time to cease to   call to mind they are again so buried and glide back a it were into   the deeper recess that they must again a if new be thought out   thence for other abode they have none but they must be drawn together   again that they may be known that is to say they must a it were be   collected together from their dispersion whence the word cogitation   is derived For cogo collect and cogito recollect have the same   relation to each other a ago and agito facio and factito But the mind   hath appropriated to itself this word cogitation so that not what is   collected any how but what is recollected ie brought together   in the mind is properly said to be cogitated or thought upon     The memory containeth also reason and law innumerable of number and   dimension none of which hath any bodily sense impressed seeing they   have neither colour nor sound nor taste nor smell nor touch I have   heard the sound of the word whereby when discussed they are denoted   but the sound are other than the thing For the sound are other in   Greek than in Latin but the thing are neither Greek nor Latin   nor any other language I have seen the line of architect the very   finest like a spider thread but those are still different they   are not the image of those line which the eye of flesh showed me he   knoweth them whosoever without any conception whatsoever of a body   recognises them within himself I have perceived also the number of the   thing with which we number all the sens of my body but those number   wherewith we number are different nor are they the image of these   and therefore they indeed are Let him who seeth them not deride me for   saying these thing and I will pity him while he derides me     All these thing I remember and how I learnt them I remember Many   thing also most falsely objected against them have I heard and   remember which though they be false yet is it not false that I   remember them and I remember also that I have discerned betwixt those   truth and these falsehood objected to them And I perceive that the   present discerning of these thing is different from remembering that   I oftentimes discerned them when I often thought upon them I both   remember then to have often understood these thing and what I now   discern and understand I lay up in my memory that hereafter I may   remember that I understand it now So then I remember also to have   remembered a if hereafter I shall call to remembrance that I have now   been able to remember these thing by the force of memory shall I call   it to remembrance     The same memory contains also the affection of my mind not in the same   manner that my mind itself contains them when it feel them but far   otherwise according to a power of it own For without rejoicing I   remember myself to have joyed and without sorrow do I recollect my   past sorrow And that I once feared I review without fear and without   desire call to mind a past desire Sometimes on the contrary with joy   do I remember my forepast sorrow and with sorrow joy Which is not   wonderful a to the body for mind is one thing body another If   I therefore with joy remember some past pain of body it is not so   wonderful But now seeing this very memory itself is mind for when we   give a thing in charge to be kept in memory we say See that you keep   it in mind and when we forget we say It did not come to my mind   and It slipped out of my mind calling the memory itself the mind   this being so how is it that when with joy I remember my past sorrow   the mind hath joy the memory hath sorrow the mind upon the joyfulness   which is in it is joyful yet the memory upon the sadness which is in   it is not sad Does the memory perchance not belong to the mind Who   will say so The memory then is a it were the belly of the mind and   joy and sadness like sweet and bitter food which when committed to   the memory are a it were passed into the belly where they may be   stowed but can not taste Ridiculous it is to imagine these to be alike   and yet are they not utterly unlike     But behold out of my memory I bring it when I say there be four   perturbation of the mind desire joy fear sorrow and whatsoever I   can dispute thereon by dividing each into it subordinate specie and   by defining it in my memory find I what to say and thence do I bring   it yet am I not disturbed by any of these perturbation when by   calling them to mind I remember them yea and before I recalled   and brought them back they were there and therefore could they by   recollection thence be brought Perchance then a meat is by chewing   the cud brought up out of the belly so by recollection these out of the   memory Why then doe not the disputer thus recollecting taste in the   mouth of his musing the sweetness of joy or the bitterness of sorrow   Is the comparison unlike in this because not in all respect like For   who would willingly speak thereof if so oft a we name grief or fear   we should be compelled to be sad or fearful And yet could we not speak   of them did we not find in our memory not only the sound of the name   according to the image impressed by the sens of the body but notion   of the very thing themselves which we never received by any avenue of   the body but which the mind itself perceiving by the experience of it   own passion committed to the memory or the memory of itself retained   without being committed unto it     But whether by image or no who can readily say Thus I name a stone   I name the sun the thing themselves not being present to my sens   but their image to my memory I name a bodily pain yet it is not   present with me when nothing ache yet unless it image were present   to my memory I should not know what to say thereof nor in discoursing   discern pain from pleasure I name bodily health being sound in body   the thing itself is present with me yet unless it image also were   present in my memory I could by no mean recall what the sound of   this name should signify Nor would the sick when health were named   recognise what were spoken unless the same image were by the force of   memory retained although the thing itself were absent from the body I   name number whereby we number and not their image but themselves   are present in my memory I name the image of the sun and that image is   present in my memory For I recall not the image of it image but the   image itself is present to me calling it to mind I name memory and   I recognise what I name And where do I recognise it but in the memory   itself Is it also present to itself by it image and not by itself     What when I name forgetfulness and withal recognise what I name   whence should I recognise it did I not remember it I speak not of the   sound of the name but of the thing which it signifies which if I had   forgotten I could not recognise what that sound signifies When then I   remember memory memory itself is through itself present with itself   but when I remember forgetfulness there are present both memory   and forgetfulness memory whereby I remember forgetfulness which I   remember But what is forgetfulness but the privation of memory How   then is it present that I remember it since when present I can not   remember But if what we remember we hold it in memory yet unless we   did remember forgetfulness we could never at the hearing of the name   recognise the thing thereby signified then forgetfulness is retained by   memory Present then it is that we forget not and being so we forget   It is to be understood from this that forgetfulness when we remember it   is not present to the memory by itself but by it image because if   it were present by itself it would not cause u to remember but to   forget Who now shall search out this who shall comprehend how it is     Lord I truly toil therein yea and toil in myself I am become a   heavy soil requiring over much sweat of the brow For we are not now   searching out the region of heaven or measuring the distance of the   star or enquiring the balancing of the earth It is I myself who   remember I the mind It is not so wonderful if what I myself am not   be far from me But what is nearer to me than myself And lo the force   of mine own memory is not understood by me though I can not so much a   name myself without it For what shall I say when it is clear to   me that I remember forgetfulness Shall I say that that is not in my   memory which I remember or shall I say that forgetfulness is for this   purpose in my memory that I might not forget Both were most absurd   What third way is there How can I say that the image of forgetfulness   is retained by my memory not forgetfulness itself when I remember it   How could I say this either seeing that when the image of any thing is   impressed on the memory the thing itself must need be first present   whence that image may be impressed For thus do I remember Carthage   thus all place where I have been thus men face whom I have seen   and thing reported by the other sens thus the health or sickness of   the body For when these thing were present my memory received from   them image which being present with me I might look on and bring   back in my mind when I remembered them in their absence If then this   forgetfulness is retained in the memory through it image not through   itself then plainly itself wa once present that it image might   be taken But when it wa present how did it write it image in the   memory seeing that forgetfulness by it presence effaces even what it   find already noted And yet in whatever way although that way be   past conceiving and explaining yet certain am I that I remember   forgetfulness itself also whereby what we remember is effaced     Great is the power of memory a fearful thing O my God a deep and   boundless manifoldness and this thing is the mind and this am I   myself What am I then O my God What nature am I A life various and   manifold and exceeding immense Behold in the plain and cave and   cavern of my memory innumerable and innumerably full of innumerable   kind of thing either through image a all body or by actual   presence a the art or by certain notion or impression a the   affection of the mind which even when the mind doth not feel the   memory retaineth while yet whatsoever is in the memory is also in the   mindover all these do I run I fly I dive on this side and on that   a far a I can and there is no end So great is the force of memory   so great the force of life even in the mortal life of man What shall I   do then O Thou my true life my God I will pas even beyond this power   of mine which is called memory yea I will pas beyond it that I may   approach unto Thee O sweet Light What sayest Thou to me See I am   mounting up through my mind towards Thee who abidest above me Yea I   now will pas beyond this power of mine which is called memory desirous   to arrive at Thee whence Thou mayest be arrived at and to cleave unto   Thee whence one may cleave unto Thee For even beast and bird have   memory else could they not return to their den and nest nor many   other thing they are used unto nor indeed could they be used to any   thing but by memory I will pas then beyond memory also that I may   arrive at Him who hath separated me from the fourfooted beast and made   me wiser than the fowl of the air I will pas beyond memory also   and where shall I find Thee Thou truly good and certain sweetness And   where shall I find Thee If I find Thee without my memory then do I not   retain Thee in my memory And how shall I find Thee if I remember Thee   not     For the woman that had lost her groat and sought it with a light   unless she had remembered it she had never found it For when it wa   found whence should she know whether it were the same unless she   remembered it I remember to have sought and found many a thing and   this I thereby know that when I wa seeking any of them and wa asked   Is this it Is that it so long said I No until that were offered   me which I sought Which had I not remembered whatever it were though   it were offered me yet should I not find it because I could not   recognise it And so it ever is when we seek and find any lost thing   Notwithstanding when any thing is by chance lost from the sight not   from the memory a any visible body yet it image is still retained   within and it is sought until it be restored to sight and when it is   found it is recognised by the image which is within nor do we say   that we have found what wa lost unless we recognise it nor can we   recognise it unless we remember it But this wa lost to the eye but   retained in the memory     But what when the memory itself loses any thing a fall out when we   forget and seek that we may recollect Where in the end do we search   but in the memory itself and there if one thing be perchance offered   instead of another we reject it until what we seek meet u and when   it doth we say This is it which we should not unless we recognised   it nor recognise it unless we remembered it Certainly then we had   forgotten it Or had not the whole escaped u but by the part whereof   we had hold wa the lost part sought for in that the memory felt that   it did not carry on together all which it wa wo nt and maimed a it   were by the curtailment of it ancient habit demanded the restoration   of what it missed For instance if we see or think of some one known   to u and having forgotten his name try to recover it whatever else   occurs connects itself not therewith because it wa not wo nt to be   thought upon together with him and therefore is rejected until that   present itself whereon the knowledge repose equably a it wonted   object And whence doe that present itself but out of the memory   itself for even when we recognise it on being reminded by another it   is thence it come For we do not believe it a something new but   upon recollection allow what wa named to be right But were it utterly   blotted out of the mind we should not remember it even when reminded   For we have not a yet utterly forgotten that which we remember   ourselves to have forgotten What then we have utterly forgotten though   lost we can not even seek after     How then do I seek Thee O Lord For when I seek Thee my God I seek a   happy life I will seek Thee that my soul may live For my body liveth   by my soul and my soul by Thee How then do I seek a happy life seeing   I have it not until I can say where I ought to say it It is enough   How seek I it By remembrance a though I had forgotten it remembering   that I had forgotten it Or desiring to learn it a a thing unknown   either never having known or so forgotten it a not even to remember   that I had forgotten it is not a happy life what all will and no one   altogether will it not where have they known it that they so will it   where seen it that they so love it Truly we have it how I know not   Yea there is another way wherein when one hath it then is he happy   and there are who are blessed in hope These have it in a lower kind   than they who have it in very deed yet are they better off than such a   are happy neither in deed nor in hope Yet even these had they it not   in some sort would not so will to be happy which that they do will is   most certain They have known it then I know not how and so have it by   some sort of knowledge what I know not and am perplexed whether it be   in the memory which if it be then we have been happy once whether all   severally or in that man who first sinned in whom also we all died   and from whom we are all born with misery I now enquire not but only   whether the happy life be in the memory For neither should we love it   did we not know it We hear the name and we all confess that we desire   the thing for we are not delighted with the mere sound For when   a Greek hears it in Latin he is not delighted not knowing what is   spoken but we Latins are delighted a would he too if he heard it in   Greek because the thing itself is neither Greek nor Latin which Greeks   and Latins and men of all other tongue long for so earnestly Known   therefore it is to all for they with one voice be asked would they   be happy they would answer without doubt they would And this could   not be unless the thing itself whereof it is the name were retained in   their memory     But is it so a one remembers Carthage who hath seen it No For a   happy life is not seen with the eye because it is not a body As we   remember number then No For these he that hath in his knowledge   seek not further to attain unto but a happy life we have in our   knowledge and therefore love it and yet still desire to attain it   that we may be happy As we remember eloquence then No For although   upon hearing this name also some call to mind the thing who still are   not yet eloquent and many who desire to be so whence it appears that   it is in their knowledge yet these have by their bodily sens observed   others to be eloquent and been delighted and desire to be the like   though indeed they would not be delighted but for some inward knowledge   thereof nor wish to be the like unless they were thus delighted   whereas a happy life we do by no bodily sense experience in others As   then we remember joy Perchance for my joy I remember even when sad   a a happy life when unhappy nor did I ever with bodily sense see   hear smell taste or touch my joy but I experienced it in my mind   when I rejoiced and the knowledge of it clave to my memory so that I   can recall it with disgust sometimes at others with longing according   to the nature of the thing wherein I remember myself to have joyed   For even from foul thing have I been immersed in a sort of joy which   now recalling I detest and execrate otherwhiles in good and honest   thing which I recall with longing although perchance no longer   present and therefore with sadness I recall former joy     Where then and when did I experience my happy life that I should   remember and love and long for it Nor is it I alone or some few   besides but we all would fain be happy which unless by some certain   knowledge we knew we should not with so certain a will desire But how   is this that if two men be asked whether they would go to the war   one perchance would answer that he would the other that he would   not but if they were asked whether they would be happy both would   instantly without any doubting say they would and for no other reason   would the one go to the war and the other not but to be happy Is it   perchance that a one look for his joy in this thing another in that   all agree in their desire of being happy a they would if they were   asked that they wished to have joy and this joy they call a happy   life Although then one obtains this joy by one mean another by   another all have one end which they strive to attain namely joy   Which being a thing which all must say they have experienced it is   therefore found in the memory and recognised whenever the name of a   happy life is mentioned     Far be it Lord far be it from the heart of Thy servant who here   confesseth unto Thee far be it that be the joy what it may I should   therefore think myself happy For there is a joy which is not given to   the ungodly but to those who love Thee for Thine own sake whose joy   Thou Thyself art And this is the happy life to rejoice to Thee of   Thee for Thee this is it and there is no other For they who think   there is another pursue some other and not the true joy Yet is not   their will turned away from some semblance of joy     It is not certain then that all wish to be happy inasmuch a they who   wish not to joy in Thee which is the only happy life do not truly   desire the happy life Or do all men desire this but because the flesh   lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh that they   can not do what they would they fall upon that which they can and are   content therewith because what they are not able to do they do not   will so strongly a would suffice to make them able For I ask any   one had he rather joy in truth or in falsehood They will a little   hesitate to say in the truth a to say that they desire to be   happy for a happy life is joy in the truth for this is a joying in   Thee Who art the Truth O God my light health of my countenance my   God This is the happy life which all desire this life which alone is   happy all desire to joy in the truth all desire I have met with many   that would deceive who would be deceived no one Where then did they   know this happy life save where they know the truth also For they love   it also since they would not be deceived And when they love a happy   life which is no other than joying in the truth then also do they love   the truth which yet they would not love were there not some notice of   it in their memory Why then joy they not in it why are they not happy   because they are more strongly taken up with other thing which have   more power to make them miserable than that which they so faintly   remember to make them happy For there is yet a little light in men let   them walk let them walk that the darkness overtake them not     But why doth truth generate hatred and the man of Thine preaching   the truth become an enemy to them whereas a happy life is loved which   is nothing else but joying in the truth unless that truth is in that   kind loved that they who love anything else would gladly have that   which they love to be the truth and because they would not be deceived   would not be convinced that they are so Therefore do they hate the   truth for that thing sake which they loved instead of the truth They   love truth when she enlightens they hate her when she reproves For   since they would not be deceived and would deceive they love her when   she discovers herself unto them and hate her when she discovers them   Whence she shall so repay them that they who would not be made manifest   by her she both against their will make manifest and herself becometh   not manifest unto them Thus thus yea thus doth the mind of man thus   blind and sick foul and illfavoured wish to be hidden but that aught   should be hidden from it it will not But the contrary is requited it   that itself should not be hidden from the Truth but the Truth is hid   from it Yet even thus miserable it had rather joy in truth than in   falsehood Happy then will it be when no distraction interposing it   shall joy in that only Truth by Whom all thing are true     See what a space I have gone over in my memory seeking Thee O Lord and   I have not found Thee without it Nor have I found any thing concerning   Thee but what I have kept in memory ever since I learnt Thee For   since I learnt Thee I have not forgotten Thee For where I found Truth   there found I my God the Truth itself which since I learnt I have   not forgotten Since then I learnt Thee Thou residest in my memory and   there do I find Thee when I call Thee to remembrance and delight in   Thee These be my holy delight which Thou hast given me in Thy mercy   having regard to my poverty     But where in my memory residest Thou O Lord where residest Thou   there what manner of lodging hast Thou framed for Thee what manner of   sanctuary hast Thou builded for Thee Thou hast given this honour to my   memory to reside in it but in what quarter of it Thou residest that   am I considering For in thinking on Thee I passed beyond such part of   it a the beast also have for I found Thee not there among the image   of corporeal thing and I came to those part to which I committed the   affection of my mind nor found Thee there And I entered into the   very seat of my mind which it hath in my memory inasmuch a the mind   remembers itself also neither wert Thou there for a Thou art not   a corporeal image nor the affection of a living being a when we   rejoice condole desire fear remember forget or the like so   neither art Thou the mind itself because Thou art the Lord God of the   mind and all these are changed but Thou remainest unchangeable over   all and yet hast vouchsafed to dwell in my memory since I learnt Thee   And why seek I now in what place thereof Thou dwellest a if there   were place therein Sure I am that in it Thou dwellest since I have   remembered Thee ever since I learnt Thee and there I find Thee when I   call Thee to remembrance     Where then did I find Thee that I might learn Thee For in my memory   Thou wert not before I learned Thee Where then did I find Thee that   I might learn Thee but in Thee above me Place there is none we go   backward and forward and there is no place Every where O Truth dost   Thou give audience to all who ask counsel of Thee and at once answerest   all though on manifold matter they ask Thy counsel Clearly dost Thou   answer though all do not clearly hear All consult Thee on what they   will though they hear not always what they will He is Thy best servant   who look not so much to hear that from Thee which himself willeth a   rather to will that which from Thee he heareth     Too late loved I Thee O Thou Beauty of ancient day yet ever new too   late I loved Thee And behold Thou wert within and I abroad and there   I searched for Thee deformed I plunging amid those fair form which   Thou hadst made Thou wert with me but I wa not with Thee Things held   me far from Thee which unless they were in Thee were not at all   Thou calledst and shoutedst and burstest my deafness Thou flashedst   shonest and scatteredst my blindness Thou breathedst odour and I   drew in breath and panted for Thee I tasted and hunger and thirst   Thou touchedst me and I burned for Thy peace     When I shall with my whole self cleave to Thee I shall no where have   sorrow or labour and my life shall wholly live a wholly full of Thee   But now since whom Thou fillest Thou liftest up because I am not full   of Thee I am a burden to myself Lamentable joy strive with joyous   sorrow and on which side is the victory I know not Woe is me Lord   have pity on me My evil sorrow strive with my good joy and on which   side is the victory I know not Woe is me Lord have pity on me Woe   is me lo I hide not my wound Thou art the Physician I the sick   Thou merciful I miserable Is not the life of man upon earth all trial   Who wish for trouble and difficulty Thou commandest them to be   endured not to be loved No man love what he endures though he love   to endure For though he rejoices that he endures he had rather there   were nothing for him to endure In adversity I long for prosperity in   prosperity I fear adversity What middle place is there betwixt these   two where the life of man is not all trial Woe to the prosperity of   the world once and again through fear of adversity and corruption of   joy Woe to the adversity of the world once and again and the third   time from the longing for prosperity and because adversity itself is   a hard thing and lest it shatter endurance Is not the life of man upon   earth all trial without any interval     And all my hope is no where but in Thy exceeding great mercy Give what   Thou enjoinest and enjoin what Thou wilt Thou enjoinest u continency   and when I knew saith one that no man can be continent unless God   give it this also wa a part of wisdom to know whose gift she is By   continency verily are we bound up and brought back into One whence we   were dissipated into many For too little doth he love Thee who love   any thing with Thee which he loveth not for Thee O love who ever   burnest and never consumest O charity my God kindle me Thou   enjoinest continency give me what Thou enjoinest and enjoin what Thou   wilt     Verily Thou enjoinest me continency from the lust of the flesh the lust   of the eye and the ambition of the world Thou enjoinest continency   from concubinage and for wedlock itself Thou hast counselled something   better than what Thou hast permitted And since Thou gavest it it wa   done even before I became a dispenser of Thy Sacrament But there yet   live in my memory whereof I have much spoken the image of such thing   a my ill custom there fixed which haunt me strengthless when I am   awake but in sleep not only so a to give pleasure but even to obtain   assent and what is very like reality Yea so far prevails the illusion   of the image in my soul and in my flesh that when asleep false   vision persuade to that which when waking the true can not Am I not   then myself O Lord my God And yet there is so much difference betwixt   myself and myself within that moment wherein I pas from waking to   sleeping or return from sleeping to waking Where is reason then   which awake resisteth such suggestion And should the thing   themselves be urged on it it remaineth unshaken Is it clasped up with   the eye is it lulled asleep with the sens of the body And whence is   it that often even in sleep we resist and mindful of our purpose and   abiding most chastely in it yield no assent to such enticement And   yet so much difference there is that when it happeneth otherwise upon   waking we return to peace of conscience and by this very difference   discover that we did not what yet we be sorry that in some way it wa   done in u     Art Thou not mighty God Almighty so a to heal all the disease of my   soul and by Thy more abundant grace to quench even the impure motion   of my sleep Thou wilt increase Lord Thy gift more and more in me   that my soul may follow me to Thee disentangled from the birdlime of   concupiscence that it rebel not against itself and even in dream not   only not through image of sense commit those debasing corruption   even to pollution of the flesh but not even to consent unto them For   that nothing of this sort should have over the pure affection even of   a sleeper the very least influence not even such a a thought would   restrainto work this not only during life but even at my present   age is not hard for the Almighty Who art able to do above all that   we ask or think But what I yet am in this kind of my evil have I   confessed unto my good Lord rejoicing with trembling in that which   Thou hast given me and bemoaning that wherein I am still imperfect   hoping that Thou wilt perfect Thy mercy in me even to perfect peace   which my outward and inward man shall have with Thee when death shall   be swallowed up in victory     There is another evil of the day which I would were sufficient for it   For by eating and drinking we repair the evil decay of our body until   Thou destroy both belly and meat when Thou shalt slay my emptiness   with a wonderful fulness and clothe this incorruptible with an eternal   incorruption But now the necessity is sweet unto me against which   sweetness I fight that I be not taken captive and carry on a daily war   by fasting often bringing my body into subjection and my pain are   removed by pleasure For hunger and thirst are in a manner pain they   burn and kill like a fever unless the medicine of nourishment come   to our aid Which since it is at hand through the consolation of Thy   gift with which land and water and air serve our weakness our   calamity is termed gratification     This hast Thou taught me that I should set myself to take food a   physic But while I am passing from the discomfort of emptiness to the   content of replenishing in the very passage the snare of concupiscence   besets me For that passing is pleasure nor is there any other way to   pas thither whither we need must pas And health being the cause of   eating and drinking there joineth itself a an attendant a dangerous   pleasure which mostly endeavour to go before it so that I may for her   sake do what I say I do or wish to do for health sake Nor have   each the same measure for what is enough for health is too little for   pleasure And oft it is uncertain whether it be the necessary care of   the body which is yet asking for sustenance or whether a voluptuous   deceivableness of greediness is proffering it service In this   uncertainty the unhappy soul rejoiceth and therein prepares an excuse   to shield itself glad that it appeareth not what sufficeth for the   moderation of health that under the cloak of health it may disguise   the matter of gratification These temptation I daily endeavour   to resist and I call on Thy right hand and to Thee do I refer my   perplexity because I have a yet no settled counsel herein     I hear the voice of my God commanding Let not your heart be   overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness Drunkenness is far from   me Thou wilt have mercy that it come not near me But full feeding   sometimes creepeth upon Thy servant Thou wilt have mercy that it may   be far from me For no one can be continent unless Thou give it Many   thing Thou givest u praying for them and what good soever we have   received before we prayed from Thee we received it yea to the end we   might afterwards know this did we before receive it Drunkard wa I   never but drunkard have I known made sober by Thee From Thee then it   wa that they who never were such should not so be a from Thee it   wa that they who have been should not ever so be and from Thee it   wa that both might know from Whom it wa I heard another voice of   Thine Go not after thy lust and from thy pleasure turn away Yea by   Thy favour have I heard that which I have much loved neither if we eat   shall we abound neither if we eat not shall we lack which is to say   neither shall the one make me plenteous nor the other miserable   I heard also another for I have learned in whatsoever state I am   therewith to be content I know how to abound and how to suffer need I   can do all thing through Christ that strengtheneth me Behold a soldier   of the heavenly camp not the dust which we are But remember Lord   that we are dust and that of dust Thou hast made man and he wa lost   and is found Nor could he of himself do this because he whom I so   loved saying this through the inbreathing of Thy inspiration wa   of the same dust I can do all thing saith he through Him that   strengtheneth me Strengthen me that I can Give what Thou enjoinest   and enjoin what Thou wilt He confesses to have received and when he   glorieth in the Lord he glorieth Another have I heard begging that he   might receive Take from me saith he the desire of the belly whence   it appeareth O my holy God that Thou givest when that is done which   Thou commandest to be done     Thou hast taught me good Father that to the pure all thing are pure   but that it is evil unto the man that eateth with offence and that   every creature of Thine is good and nothing to be refused which is   received with thanksgiving and that meat commendeth u not to God and   that no man should judge u in meat or drink and that he which eateth   let him not despise him that eateth not and let not him that eateth   not judge him that eateth These thing have I learned thanks be   to Thee praise to Thee my God my Master knocking at my ear   enlightening my heart deliver me out of all temptation I fear not   uncleanness of meat but the uncleanness of lusting I know that Noah   wa permitted to eat all kind of flesh that wa good for food that   Elijah wa fed with flesh that endued with an admirable abstinence wa   not polluted by feeding on living creature locust I know also that   Esau wa deceived by lusting for lentiles and that David blamed himself   for desiring a draught of water and that our King wa tempted not   concerning flesh but bread And therefore the people in the wilderness   also deserved to be reproved not for desiring flesh but because in   the desire of food they murmured against the Lord     Placed then amid these temptation I strive daily against concupiscence   in eating and drinking For it is not of such nature that I can settle   on cutting it off once for all and never touching it afterward a   I could of concubinage The bridle of the throat then is to be held   attempered between slackness and stiffness And who is he O Lord who   is not some whit transported beyond the limit of necessity whoever he   is he is a great one let him make Thy Name great But I am not such   for I am a sinful man Yet do I too magnify Thy name and He maketh   intercession to Thee for my sin who hath overcome the world numbering   me among the weak member of His body because Thine eye have seen that   of Him which is imperfect and in Thy book shall all be written     With the allurement of smell I am not much concerned When absent I   do not miss them when present I do not refuse them yet ever ready to   be without them So I seem to myself perchance I am deceived For that   also is a mournful darkness whereby my ability within me are hidden   from me so that my mind making enquiry into herself of her own power   venture not readily to believe herself because even what is in it   is mostly hidden unless experience reveal it And no one ought to be   secure in that life the whole whereof is called a trial that he who   hath been capable of worse to be made better may not likewise of better   be made worse Our only hope only confidence only assured promise is   Thy mercy     The delight of the ear had more firmly entangled and subdued me but   Thou didst loosen and free me Now in those melody which Thy word   breathe soul into when sung with a sweet and attuned voice I do   a little repose yet not so a to be held thereby but that I can   disengage myself when I will But with the word which are their   life and whereby they find admission into me themselves seek in my   affection a place of some estimation and I can scarcely assign them   one suitable For at one time I seem to myself to give them more honour   than is seemly feeling our mind to be more holily and fervently raised   unto a flame of devotion by the holy word themselves when thus sung   than when not and that the several affection of our spirit by a sweet   variety have their own proper measure in the voice and singing by   some hidden correspondence wherewith they are stirred up But this   contentment of the flesh to which the soul must not be given over to be   enervated doth oft beguile me the sense not so waiting upon reason a   patiently to follow her but having been admitted merely for her sake   it strives even to run before her and lead her Thus in these thing I   unawares sin but afterwards am aware of it     At other time shunning overanxiously this very deception I err in   too great strictness and sometimes to that degree a to wish the whole   melody of sweet music which is used to Davids Psalter banished from   my ear and the Churchs too and that mode seems to me safer which I   remember to have been often told me of Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria   who made the reader of the psalm utter it with so slight inflection   of voice that it wa nearer speaking than singing Yet again when   I remember the tear I shed at the Psalmody of Thy Church in the   beginning of my recovered faith and how at this time I am moved not   with the singing but with the thing sung when they are sung with a   clear voice and modulation most suitable I acknowledge the great use   of this institution Thus I fluctuate between peril of pleasure and   approved wholesomeness inclined the rather though not a pronouncing   an irrevocable opinion to approve of the usage of singing in the   church that so by the delight of the ear the weaker mind may rise to   the feeling of devotion Yet when it befalls me to be more moved with   the voice than the word sung I confess to have sinned penally and   then had rather not hear music See now my state weep with me and weep   for me ye whoso regulate your feeling within a that good action   ensues For you who do not act these thing touch not you But Thou O   Lord my God hearken behold and see and have mercy and heal me Thou   in whose presence I have become a problem to myself and that is my   infirmity     There remains the pleasure of these eye of my flesh on which to make   my confession in the hearing of the ear of Thy temple those brotherly   and devout ear and so to conclude the temptation of the lust of   the flesh which yet assail me groaning earnestly and desiring to be   clothed upon with my house from heaven The eye love fair and varied   form and bright and soft colour Let not these occupy my soul let   God rather occupy it who made these thing very good indeed yet is   He my good not they And these affect me waking the whole day nor   is any rest given me from them a there is from musical sometimes in   silence from all voice For this queen of colour the light bathing   all which we behold wherever I am through the day gliding by me in   varied form soothes me when engaged on other thing and not observing   it And so strongly doth it entwine itself that if it be suddenly   withdrawn it is with longing sought for and if absent long saddeneth   the mind     O Thou Light which Tobias saw when these eye closed he taught his   son the way of life and himself went before with the foot of charity   never swerving Or which Isaac saw when his fleshly eye being heavy   and closed by old age it wa vouchsafed him not knowingly to bless   his son but by blessing to know them Or which Jacob saw when he   also blind through great age with illumined heart in the person of   his son shed light on the different race of the future people in   them foresignified and laid his hand mystically crossed upon   his grandchild by Joseph not a their father by his outward eye   corrected them but a himself inwardly discerned This is the light it   is one and all are one who see and love it But that corporeal light   whereof I spake it seasoneth the life of this world for her blind   lover with an enticing and dangerous sweetness But they who know how   to praise Thee for it O allcreating Lord take it up in Thy hymn   and are not taken up with it in their sleep Such would I be These   seduction of the eye I resist lest my foot wherewith I walk upon Thy   way be ensnared and I lift up mine invisible eye to Thee that Thou   wouldest pluck my foot out of the snare Thou dost ever and anon pluck   them out for they are ensnared Thou ceasest not to pluck them out   while I often entangle myself in the snare on all side laid because   Thou that keepest Israel shalt neither slumber nor sleep     What innumerable toy made by diver art and manufacture in our   apparel shoe utensil and all sort of work in picture also and   diver image and these far exceeding all necessary and moderate use   and all pious meaning have men added to tempt their own eye withal   outwardly following what themselves make inwardly forsaking Him by whom   themselves were made and destroying that which themselves have been   made But I my God and my Glory do hence also sing a hymn to Thee and   do consecrate praise to Him who consecrateth me because those beautiful   pattern which through men soul are conveyed into their cunning   hand come from that Beauty which is above our soul which my soul   day and night sigheth after But the framer and follower of the   outward beauty derive thence the rule of judging of them but not of   using them And He is there though they perceive Him not that so they   might not wander but keep their strength for Thee and not scatter it   abroad upon pleasurable weariness And I though I speak and see this   entangle my step with these outward beauty but Thou pluckest me out   O Lord Thou pluckest me out because Thy lovingkindness is before my   eye For I am taken miserably and Thou pluckest me out mercifully   sometimes not perceiving it when I had but lightly lighted upon them   otherwhiles with pain because I had stuck fast in them     To this is added another form of temptation more manifoldly dangerous   For besides that concupiscence of the flesh which consisteth in the   delight of all sens and pleasure wherein it slave who go far from   Thee waste and perish the soul hath through the same sens of the   body a certain vain and curious desire veiled under the title of   knowledge and learning not of delighting in the flesh but of making   experiment through the flesh The seat whereof being in the appetite   of knowledge and sight being the sense chiefly used for attaining   knowledge it is in Divine language called The lust of the eye For to   see belongeth properly to the eye yet we use this word of the other   sens also when we employ them in seeking knowledge For we do not   say hark how it flash or smell how it glow or taste how it shine   or feel how it gleam for all these are said to be seen And yet we   say not only see how it shineth which the eye alone can perceive but   also see how it soundeth see how it smelleth see how it tasteth   see how hard it is And so the general experience of the sens a   wa said is called The lust of the eye because the office of seeing   wherein the eye hold the prerogative the other sens by way   of similitude take to themselves when they make search after any   knowledge     But by this may more evidently be discerned wherein pleasure and   wherein curiosity is the object of the sens for pleasure seeketh   object beautiful melodious fragrant savoury soft but curiosity   for trial sake the contrary a well not for the sake of suffering   annoyance but out of the lust of making trial and knowing them For   what pleasure hath it to see in a mangled carcase what will make you   shudder and yet if it be lying near they flock thither to be made   sad and to turn pale Even in sleep they are afraid to see it As if   when awake any one forced them to see it or any report of it beauty   drew them thither Thus also in the other sens which it were long to   go through From this disease of curiosity are all those strange sight   exhibited in the theatre Hence men go on to search out the hidden   power of nature which is besides our end which to know profit not   and wherein men desire nothing but to know Hence also if with that   same end of perverted knowledge magical art be enquired by Hence also   in religion itself is God tempted when sign and wonder are demanded   of Him not desired for any good end but merely to make trial of     In this so vast wilderness full of snare and danger behold many of   them I have cut off and thrust out of my heart a Thou hast given me   O God of my salvation And yet when dare I say since so many thing of   this kind buzz on all side about our daily lifewhen dare I say that   nothing of this sort engages my attention or cause in me an idle   interest True the theatre do not now carry me away nor care I to   know the course of the star nor did my soul ever consult ghost   departed all sacrilegious mystery I detest From Thee O Lord my God   to whom I owe humble and singlehearted service by what artifice   and suggestion doth the enemy deal with me to desire some sign But I   beseech Thee by our King and by our pure and holy country Jerusalem   that a any consenting thereto is far from me so may it ever be further   and further But when I pray Thee for the salvation of any my end and   intention is far different Thou givest and wilt give me to follow Thee   willingly doing what Thou wilt     Notwithstanding in how many most petty and contemptible thing is our   curiosity daily tempted and how often we give way who can recount How   often do we begin a if we were tolerating people telling vain story   lest we offend the weak then by degree we take interest therein I go   not now to the circus to see a dog coursing a hare but in the field   if passing that coursing peradventure will distract me even from some   weighty thought and draw me after it not that I turn aside the body   of my beast yet still incline my mind thither And unless Thou having   made me see my infirmity didst speedily admonish me either through the   sight itself by some contemplation to rise towards Thee or altogether   to despise and pas it by I dully stand fixed therein What when   sitting at home a lizard catching fly or a spider entangling them   rushing into her net ofttimes take my attention Is the thing   different because they are but small creature I go on from them to   praise Thee the wonderful Creator and Orderer of all but this doe not   first draw my attention It is one thing to rise quickly another not   to fall And of such thing is my life full and my one hope is Thy   wonderful great mercy For when our heart becomes the receptacle of such   thing and is overcharged with throng of this abundant vanity then   are our prayer also thereby often interrupted and distracted and   whilst in Thy presence we direct the voice of our heart to Thine ear   this so great concern is broken off by the rushing in of I know not what   idle thought Shall we then account this also among thing of slight   concernment or shall aught bring u back to hope save Thy complete   mercy since Thou hast begun to change u     And Thou knowest how far Thou hast already changed me who first   healedst me of the lust of vindicating myself that so Thou mightest   forgive all the rest of my iniquity and heal all my infirmity   and redeem life from corruption and crown me with mercy and pity and   satisfy my desire with good thing who didst curb my pride with Thy   fear and tame my neck to Thy yoke And now I bear it and it is light   unto me because so hast Thou promised and hast made it and verily so   it wa and I knew it not when I feared to take it     But O Lord Thou alone Lord without pride because Thou art the only   true Lord who hast no lord hath this third kind of temptation also   ceased from me or can it cease through this whole life To wish   namely to be feared and loved of men for no other end but that we   may have a joy therein which is no joy A miserable life this and a foul   boastfulness Hence especially it come that men do neither purely love   nor fear Thee And therefore dost Thou resist the proud and givest   grace to the humble yea Thou thunderest down upon the ambition of the   world and the foundation of the mountain tremble Because now certain   office of human society make it necessary to be loved and feared of   men the adversary of our true blessedness layeth hard at u every   where spreading his snare of welldone welldone that greedily   catching at them we may be taken unawares and sever our joy from Thy   truth and set it in the deceivingness of men and be pleased at being   loved and feared not for Thy sake but in Thy stead and thus having   been made like him he may have them for his own not in the band of   charity but in the bond of punishment who purposed to set his throne   in the north that dark and chilled they might serve him pervertedly   and crookedly imitating Thee But we O Lord behold we are Thy little   flock posse u a Thine stretch Thy wing over u and let u fly   under them Be Thou our glory let u be loved for Thee and Thy word   feared in u Who would be praised of men when Thou blamest will not be   defended of men when Thou judgest nor delivered when Thou condemnest   But whennot the sinner is praised in the desire of his soul nor he   blessed who doth ungodlily buta man is praised for some gift which   Thou hast given him and he rejoices more at the praise for himself than   that he hath the gift for which he is praised he also is praised while   Thou dispraisest better is he who praised than he who is praised For   the one took pleasure in the gift of God in man the other wa better   pleased with the gift of man than of God     By these temptation we are assailed daily O Lord without ceasing are   we assailed Our daily furnace is the tongue of men And in this way   also Thou commandest u continence Give what Thou enjoinest and enjoin   what Thou wilt Thou knowest on this matter the groan of my heart and   the flood of mine eye For I can not learn how far I am more cleansed   from this plague and I much fear my secret sin which Thine eye know   mine do not For in other kind of temptation I have some sort of mean   of examining myself in this scarce any For in refraining my mind   from the pleasure of the flesh and idle curiosity I see how much I   have attained lo when I do without them foregoing or not having them   For then I ask myself how much more or le troublesome it is to me not   to have them Then rich which are desired that they may serve to   some one or two or all of the three concupiscence if the soul can not   discern whether when it hath them it despiseth them they may be   cast aside that so it may prove itself But to be without praise   and therein essay our power must we live ill yea so abandonedly and   atrociously that no one should know without detesting u What greater   madness can be said or thought of But if praise useth and ought to   accompany a good life and good work we ought a little to forego it   company a good life itself Yet I know not whether I can well or ill   be without anything unless it be absent     What then do I confess unto Thee in this kind of temptation O Lord   What but that I am delighted with praise but with truth itself more   than with praise For were it proposed to me whether I would being   frenzied in error on all thing be praised by all men or being   consistent and most settled in the truth be blamed by all I see which   I should choose Yet fain would I that the approbation of another should   not even increase my joy for any good in me Yet I own it doth increase   it and not so only but dispraise doth diminish it And when I am   troubled at this my misery an excuse occurs to me which of what value   it is Thou God knowest for it leaf me uncertain For since Thou hast   commanded u not continency alone that is from what thing to refrain   our love but righteousness also that is whereon to bestow it and   hast willed u to love not Thee only but our neighbour also often   when pleased with intelligent praise I seem to myself to be pleased   with the proficiency or towardliness of my neighbour or to be grieved   for evil in him when I hear him dispraise either what he understands   not or is good For sometimes I am grieved at my own praise either   when those thing be praised in me in which I mislike myself or even   lesser and slight good are more esteemed than they ought But again how   know I whether I am therefore thus affected because I would not have   him who praiseth me differ from me about myself not a being influenced   by concern for him but because those same good thing which please me   in myself please me more when they please another also For some how I   am not praised when my judgment of myself is not praised forasmuch   a either those thing are praised which displease me or those more   which please me le Am I then doubtful of myself in this matter     Behold in Thee O Truth I see that I ought not to be moved at my own   praise for my own sake but for the good of my neighbour And whether   it be so with me I know not For herein I know le of myself than of   Thee I beseech now O my God discover to me myself also that I may   confess unto my brother who are to pray for me wherein I find myself   maimed Let me examine myself again more diligently If in my praise I   am moved with the good of my neighbour why am I le moved if another   be unjustly dispraised than if it be myself Why am I more stung by   reproach cast upon myself than at that cast upon another with the   same injustice before me Know I not this also or is it at last that I   deceive myself and do not the truth before Thee in my heart and tongue   This madness put far from me O Lord lest mine own mouth be to me the   sinner oil to make fat my head I am poor and needy yet best while   in hidden groanings I displease myself and seek Thy mercy until what   is lacking in my defective state be renewed and perfected on to that   peace which the eye of the proud knoweth not     Yet the word which cometh out of the mouth and deed known to men   bring with them a most dangerous temptation through the love of praise   which to establish a certain excellency of our own solicits and   collect men suffrage It tempts even when it is reproved by myself   in myself on the very ground that it is reproved and often glory   more vainly of the very contempt of vainglory and so it is no longer   contempt of vainglory whereof it glory for it doth not contemn when   it glorieth     Within also within is another evil arising out of a like temptation   whereby men become vain pleasing themselves in themselves though they   please not or displease or care not to please others But pleasing   themselves they much displease Thee not only taking pleasure in thing   not good a if good but in Thy good thing a though their own or   even if a Thine yet a though for their own merit or even if a   though from Thy grace yet not with brotherly rejoicing but envying   that grace to others In all these and the like peril and travail   Thou seest the trembling of my heart and I rather feel my wound to be   cured by Thee than not inflicted by me     Where hast Thou not walked with me O Truth teaching me what to beware   and what to desire when I referred to Thee what I could discover   here below and consulted Thee With my outward sens a I might I   surveyed the world and observed the life which my body hath from me   and these my sens Thence entered I the recess of my memory those   manifold and spacious chamber wonderfully furnished with innumerable   store and I considered and stood aghast being able to discern   nothing of these thing without Thee and finding none of them to be   Thee Nor wa I myself who found out these thing who went over them   all and laboured to distinguish and to value every thing according   to it dignity taking some thing upon the report of my sens   questioning about others which I felt to be mingled with myself   numbering and distinguishing the reporter themselves and in the large   treasurehouse of my memory revolving some thing storing up others   drawing out others Nor yet wa I myself when I did this ie that my   power whereby I did it neither wa it Thou for Thou art the abiding   light which I consulted concerning all these whether they were   what they were and how to be valued and I heard Thee directing and   commanding me and this I often do this delight me and a far a I   may be freed from necessary duty unto this pleasure have I recourse   Nor in all these which I run over consulting Thee can I find any safe   place for my soul but in Thee whither my scattered member may   be gathered and nothing of me depart from Thee And sometimes Thou   admittest me to an affection very unusual in my inmost soul rising to   a strange sweetness which if it were perfected in me I know not what   in it would not belong to the life to come But through my miserable   encumbrance I sink down again into these lower thing and am swept   back by former custom and am held and greatly weep but am greatly   held So much doth the burden of a bad custom weigh u down Here I can   stay but would not there I would but can not both way miserable     Thus then have I considered the sickness of my sin in that threefold   concupiscence and have called Thy right hand to my help For with a   wounded heart have I beheld Thy brightness and stricken back I said   Who can attain thither I am cast away from the sight of Thine eye   Thou art the Truth who presidest over all but I through my covetousness   would not indeed forego Thee but would with Thee posse a lie a no   man would in such wise speak falsely a himself to be ignorant of the   truth So then I lost Thee because Thou vouchsafest not to be possessed   with a lie     Whom could I find to reconcile me to Thee wa I to have recourse to   Angels by what prayer by what sacrament Many endeavouring to return   unto Thee and of themselves unable have a I hear tried this and   fallen into the desire of curious vision and been accounted worthy   to be deluded For they being high minded sought Thee by the pride of   learning swelling out rather than smiting upon their breast and so   by the agreement of their heart drew unto themselves the prince of the   air the fellowconspirators of their pride by whom through magical   influence they were deceived seeking a mediator by whom they might   be purged and there wa none For the devil it wa transforming   himself into an Angel of light And it much enticed proud flesh that he   had no body of flesh For they were mortal and sinner but thou Lord   to whom they proudly sought to be reconciled art immortal and without   sin But a mediator between God and man must have something like to God   something like to men lest being in both like to man he should be   far from God or if in both like God too unlike man and so not be a   mediator That deceitful mediator then by whom in Thy secret judgment   pride deserved to be deluded hath one thing in common with man that   is sin another he would seem to have in common with God and not being   clothed with the mortality of flesh would vaunt himself to be immortal   But since the wage of sin is death this hath he in common with men   that with them he should be condemned to death     But the true Mediator Whom in Thy secret mercy Thou hast showed to the   humble and sentest that by His example also they might learn that   same humility that Mediator between God and man the Man Christ Jesus   appeared betwixt mortal sinner and the immortal just One mortal with   men just with God that because the wage of righteousness is life and   peace He might by a righteousness conjoined with God make void that   death of sinner now made righteous which He willed to have in common   with them Hence He wa showed forth to holy men of old that so they   through faith in His Passion to come a we through faith of it passed   might be saved For a Man He wa a Mediator but a the Word not in   the middle between God and man because equal to God and God with God   and together one God     How hast Thou loved u good Father who sparedst not Thine only Son   but deliveredst Him up for u ungodly How hast Thou loved u for whom   He that thought it no robbery to be equal with Thee wa made subject   even to the death of the cross He alone free among the dead having   power to lay down His life and power to take it again for u to Thee   both Victor and Victim and therefore Victor because the Victim for   u to Thee Priest and Sacrifice and therefore Priest because the   Sacrifice making u to Thee of servant son by being born of Thee   and serving u Well then is my hope strong in Him that Thou wilt heal   all my infirmity by Him Who sitteth at Thy right hand and maketh   intercession for u else should I despair For many and great are my   infirmity many they are and great but Thy medicine is mightier We   might imagine that Thy Word wa far from any union with man and despair   of ourselves unless He had been made flesh and dwelt among u     Affrighted with my sin and the burden of my misery I had cast in my   heart and had purposed to flee to the wilderness but Thou forbadest   me and strengthenedst me saying Therefore Christ died for all that   they which live may now no longer live unto themselves but unto Him   that died for them See Lord I cast my care upon Thee that I may   live and consider wondrous thing out of Thy law Thou knowest my   unskilfulness and my infirmity teach me and heal me He Thine only   Son in Whom are hid all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge hath   redeemed me with His blood Let not the proud speak evil of me because   I meditate on my ransom and eat and drink and communicate it and   poor desired to be satisfied from Him amongst those that eat and are   satisfied and they shall praise the Lord who seek Him           BOOK XI       Lord since eternity is Thine art Thou ignorant of what I say to Thee   or dost Thou see in time what passeth in time Why then do I lay in   order before Thee so many relation Not of a truth that Thou mightest   learn them through me but to stir up mine own and my reader devotion   towards Thee that we may all say Great is the Lord and greatly to be   praised I have said already and again will say for love of Thy   love do I this For we pray also and yet Truth hath said Your Father   knoweth what you have need of before you ask It is then our affection   which we lay open unto Thee confessing our own misery and Thy   mercy upon u that Thou mayest free u wholly since Thou hast begun   that we may cease to be wretched in ourselves and be blessed in Thee   seeing Thou hast called u to become poor in spirit and meek and   mourner and hungering and athirst after righteousness and merciful   and pure in heart and peacemaker See I have told Thee many thing   a I could and a I would because Thou first wouldest that I should   confess unto Thee my Lord God For Thou art good for Thy mercy   endureth for ever     But how shall I suffice with the tongue of my pen to utter all Thy   exhortation and all Thy terror and comfort and guidance whereby   Thou broughtest me to preach Thy Word and dispense Thy Sacrament to Thy   people And if I suffice to utter them in order the drop of time are   precious with me and long have I burned to meditate in Thy law and   therein to confess to Thee my skill and unskilfulness the daybreak of   Thy enlightening and the remnant of my darkness until infirmity be   swallowed up by strength And I would not have aught besides steal away   those hour which I find free from the necessity of refreshing my body   and the power of my mind and of the service which we owe to men or   which though we owe not we yet pay     O Lord my god give ear unto my prayer and let Thy mercy hearken unto   my desire because it is anxious not for myself alone but would serve   brotherly charity and Thou seest my heart that so it is I would   sacrifice to Thee the service of my thought and tongue do Thou give me   what I may offer Thee For I am poor and needy Thou rich to all that   call upon Thee Who inaccessible to care carest for u Circumcise   from all rashness and all lying both my inward and outward lip let   Thy Scriptures be my pure delight let me not be deceived in them nor   deceive out of them Lord hearken and pity O Lord my God Light of the   blind and Strength of the weak yea also Light of those that see and   Strength of the strong hearken unto my soul and hear it cry out of   the depth For if Thine ear be not with u in the depth also whither   shall we go whither cry The day is Thine and the night is Thine at   Thy beck the moment flee by Grant thereof a space for our meditation   in the hidden thing of Thy law and close it not against u who knock   For not in vain wouldest Thou have the darksome secret of so many page   written nor are those forest without their hart which retire therein   and range and walk feed lie down and ruminate Perfect me O   Lord and reveal them unto me Behold Thy voice is my joy Thy voice   exceedeth the abundance of pleasure Give what I love for I do love   and this hast Thou given forsake not Thy own gift nor despise Thy   green herb that thirsteth Let me confess unto Thee whatsoever I shall   find in Thy book and hear the voice of praise and drink in Thee   and meditate on the wonderful thing out of Thy law even from the   beginning wherein Thou madest the heaven and the earth unto the   everlasting reigning of Thy holy city with Thee     Lord have mercy on me and hear my desire For it is not I deem of   the earth not of gold and silver and precious stone or gorgeous   apparel or honour and office or the pleasure of the flesh or   necessary for the body and for this life of our pilgrimage all which   shall be added unto those that seek Thy kingdom and Thy righteousness   Behold O Lord my God wherein is my desire The wicked have told me of   delight but not such a Thy law O Lord Behold wherein is my desire   Behold Father behold and see and approve and be it pleasing in the   sight of Thy mercy that I may find grace before Thee that the inward   part of Thy word be opened to me knocking I beseech by our Lord Jesus   Christ Thy Son the Man of Thy right hand the Son of man whom Thou   hast established for Thyself a Thy Mediator and ours through Whom   Thou soughtest u not seeking Thee but soughtest u that we might   seek TheeThy Word through Whom Thou madest all thing and among   them me alsoThy OnlyBegotten through Whom Thou calledst to   adoption the believing people and therein me alsoI beseech Thee by   Him who sitteth at Thy right hand and intercedeth with Thee for u   in Whom are hidden all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge These do   I seek in Thy book Of Him did Moses write this saith Himself this   saith the Truth     I would hear and understand how In the Beginning Thou madest the   heaven and earth Moses wrote this wrote and departed passed hence   from Thee to Thee nor is he now before me For if he were I would hold   him and ask him and beseech him by Thee to open these thing unto me   and would lay the ear of my body to the sound bursting out of his   mouth And should he speak Hebrew in vain will it strike on my sens   nor would aught of it touch my mind but if Latin I should know what   he said But whence should I know whether he spake truth Yea and if   I knew this also should I know it from him Truly within me within in   the chamber of my thought Truth neither Hebrew nor Greek nor Latin   nor barbarian without organ of voice or tongue or sound of syllable   would say It is truth and I forthwith should say confidently to that   man of Thine thou sayest truly Whereas then I can not enquire of him   Thee Thee I beseech O Truth full of Whom he spake truth Thee my   God I beseech forgive my sin and Thou who gavest him Thy servant to   speak these thing give to me also to understand them     Behold the heaven and the earth are they proclaim that they were   created for they change and vary Whereas whatsoever hath not been   made and yet is hath nothing in it which before it had not and   this it is to change and vary They proclaim also that they made not   themselves therefore we are because we have been made we were not   therefore before we were so a to make ourselves Now the evidence   of the thing is the voice of the speaker Thou therefore Lord madest   them who art beautiful for they are beautiful who art good for they   are good who art for they are yet are they not beautiful nor good   nor are they a Thou their Creator art compared with Whom they are   neither beautiful nor good nor are This we know thanks be to Thee   And our knowledge compared with Thy knowledge is ignorance     But how didst Thou make the heaven and the earth and what the engine of   Thy so mighty fabric For it wa not a a human artificer forming one   body from another according to the discretion of his mind which can   in some way invest with such a form a it seeth in itself by it inward   eye And whence should he be able to do this unless Thou hadst made   that mind and he invests with a form what already existeth and hath   a being a clay or stone or wood or gold or the like And whence   should they be hadst not Thou appointed them Thou madest the artificer   his body Thou the mind commanding the limb Thou the matter whereof he   make any thing Thou the apprehension whereby to take in his art and   see within what he doth without Thou the sense of his body whereby   a by an interpreter he may from mind to matter convey that which he   doth and report to his mind what is done that it within may consult   the truth which presideth over itself whether it be well done or no   All these praise Thee the Creator of all But how dost Thou make them   how O God didst Thou make heaven and earth Verily neither in the   heaven nor in the earth didst Thou make heaven and earth nor in the   air or water seeing these also belong to the heaven and the earth   nor in the whole world didst Thou make the whole world because there   wa no place where to make it before it wa made that it might be Nor   didst Thou hold any thing in Thy hand whereof to make heaven and earth   For whence shouldest Thou have this which Thou hadst not made thereof   to make any thing For what is but because Thou art Therefore Thou   spokest and they were made and in Thy Word Thou madest them     But how didst Thou speak In the way that the voice came out of the   cloud saying This is my beloved Son For that voice passed by and   passed away began and ended the syllable sounded and passed away   the second after the first the third after the second and so forth in   order until the last after the rest and silence after the last Whence   it is abundantly clear and plain that the motion of a creature expressed   it itself temporal serving Thy eternal will And these Thy word   created for a time the outward ear reported to the intelligent soul   whose inward ear lay listening to Thy Eternal Word But she compared   these word sounding in time with that Thy Eternal Word in silence and   said It is different far different These word are far beneath me   nor are they because they flee and pas away but the Word of my Lord   abideth above me for ever If then in sounding and passing word Thou   saidst that heaven and earth should be made and so madest heaven and   earth there wa a corporeal creature before heaven and earth by whose   motion in time that voice might take his course in time But there wa   nought corporeal before heaven and earth or if there were surely Thou   hadst without such a passing voice created that whereof to make this   passing voice by which to say Let the heaven and the earth be made   For whatsoever that were whereof such a voice were made unless by   Thee it were made it could not be at all By what Word then didst Thou   speak that a body might be made whereby these word again might be   made     Thou callest u then to understand the Word God with Thee God Which   is spoken eternally and by It are all thing spoken eternally For what   wa spoken wa not spoken successively one thing concluded that the   next might be spoken but all thing together and eternally Else have   we time and change and not a true eternity nor true immortality This I   know O my God and give thanks I know I confess to Thee O Lord and   with me there know and blesses Thee whoso is not unthankful to assure   Truth We know Lord we know since inasmuch a anything is not which   wa and is which wa not so far forth it dieth and ariseth Nothing   then of Thy Word doth give place or replace because It is truly   immortal and eternal And therefore unto the Word coeternal with Thee   Thou dost at once and eternally say all that Thou dost say and whatever   Thou sayest shall be made is made nor dost Thou make otherwise than by   saying and yet are not all thing made together or everlasting which   Thou makest by saying     Why I beseech Thee O Lord my God I see it in a way but how to   express it I know not unless it be that whatsoever begin to be and   leaf off to be begin then and leaf off then when in Thy eternal   Reason it is known that it ought to begin or leave off in which Reason   nothing beginneth or leaveth off This is Thy Word which is also the   Beginning because also It speaketh unto u Thus in the Gospel He   speaketh through the flesh and this sounded outwardly in the ear of   men that it might be believed and sought inwardly and found in   the eternal Verity where the good and only Master teacheth all His   disciple There Lord hear I Thy voice speaking unto me because He   speaketh u who teacheth u but He that teacheth u not though   He speaketh to u He speaketh not Who now teacheth u but the   unchangeable Truth for even when we are admonished through a changeable   creature we are but led to the unchangeable Truth where we learn   truly while we stand and hear Him and rejoice greatly because of the   Bridegrooms voice restoring u to Him from Whom we are And therefore   the Beginning because unless It abided there should not when we   went astray be whither to return But when we return from error it is   through knowing and that we may know He teacheth u because He is the   Beginning and speaking unto u     In this Beginning O God hast Thou made heaven and earth in Thy   Word in Thy Son in Thy Power in Thy Wisdom in Thy Truth wondrously   speaking and wondrously making Who shall comprehend Who declare   it What is that which gleam through me and strike my heart without   hurting it and I shudder and kindle I shudder inasmuch a I am unlike   it I kindle inasmuch a I am like it It is Wisdom Wisdoms self   which gleameth through me severing my cloudiness which yet again   mantle over me fainting from it through the darkness which for my   punishment gather upon me For my strength is brought down in need   so that I can not support my blessing till Thou Lord Who hast been   gracious to all mine iniquity shalt heal all my infirmity For   Thou shalt also redeem my life from corruption and crown me with loving   kindness and tender mercy and shalt satisfy my desire with good   thing because my youth shall be renewed like an eagle For in hope   we are saved wherefore we through patience wait for Thy promise Let   him that is able hear Thee inwardly discoursing out of Thy oracle I   will boldly cry out How wonderful are Thy work O Lord in Wisdom   hast Thou made them all and this Wisdom is the Beginning and in that   Beginning didst Thou make heaven and earth     Lo are they not full of their old leaven who say to u What wa   God doing before He made heaven and earth For if say they He were   unemployed and wrought not why doe He not also henceforth and for   ever a He did heretofore For did any new motion arise in God and a   new will to make a creature which He had never before made how then   would that be a true eternity where there ariseth a will which wa   not For the will of God is not a creature but before the creature   seeing nothing could be created unless the will of the Creator had   preceded The will of God then belongeth to His very Substance And   if aught have arisen in Gods Substance which before wa not that   Substance can not be truly called eternal But if the will of God ha   been from eternity that the creature should be why wa not the creature   also from eternity     Who speak thus do not yet understand Thee O Wisdom of God Light of   soul understand not yet how the thing be made which by Thee and   in Thee are made yet they strive to comprehend thing eternal whilst   their heart fluttereth between the motion of thing past and to come   and is still unstable Who shall hold it and fix it that it be settled   awhile and awhile catch the glory of that everfixed Eternity and   compare it with the time which are never fixed and see that it can not   be compared and that a long time can not become long but out of many   motion passing by which can not be prolonged altogether but that in   the Eternal nothing passeth but the whole is present whereas no time   is all at once present and that all time past is driven on by time to   come and all to come followeth upon the past and all past and to come   is created and flow out of that which is ever present Who shall hold   the heart of man that it may stand still and see how eternity ever   stillstanding neither past nor to come uttereth the time past and to   come Can my hand do this or the hand of my mouth by speech bring about   a thing so great     See I answer him that asketh What did God before He made heaven and   earth I answer not a one is said to have done merrily eluding the   pressure of the question He wa preparing hell saith he for pryers   into mystery It is one thing to answer enquiry another to make   sport of enquirer So I answer not for rather had I answer I know   not what I know not than so a to raise a laugh at him who asketh   deep thing and gain praise for one who answereth false thing But I   say that Thou our God art the Creator of every creature and if by   the name heaven and earth every creature be understood I boldly say   that before God made heaven and earth He did not make any thing For   if He made what did He make but a creature And would I knew whatsoever   I desire to know to my profit a I know that no creature wa made   before there wa made any creature     But if any excursive brain rove over the image of forepassed time and   wonder that Thou the God Almighty and Allcreating and Allsupporting   Maker of heaven and earth didst for innumerable age forbear from so   great a work before Thou wouldest make it let him awake and consider   that he wonder at false conceit For whence could innumerable age   pas by which Thou madest not Thou the Author and Creator of all   age or what time should there be which were not made by Thee or   how should they pas by if they never were Seeing then Thou art the   Creator of all time if any time wa before Thou madest heaven and   earth why say they that Thou didst forego working For that very time   didst Thou make nor could time pas by before Thou madest those   time But if before heaven and earth there wa no time why is it   demanded what Thou then didst For there wa no then when there wa   no time     Nor dost Thou by time precede time else shouldest Thou not precede   all time But Thou precedest all thing past by the sublimity of   an everpresent eternity and surpassest all future because they are   future and when they come they shall be past but Thou art the Same   and Thy year fail not Thy year neither come nor go whereas ours both   come and go that they all may come Thy year stand together because   they do stand nor are departing thrust out by coming year for they   pas not away but ours shall all be when they shall no more be Thy   year are one day and Thy day is not daily but Today seeing Thy   Today give not place unto tomorrow for neither doth it replace   yesterday Thy Today is Eternity therefore didst Thou beget The   Coeternal to whom Thou saidst This day have I begotten Thee Thou hast   made all thing and before all time Thou art neither in any time wa   time not     At no time then hadst Thou not made any thing because time itself Thou   madest And no time are coeternal with Thee because Thou abidest   but if they abode they should not be time For what is time Who can   readily and briefly explain this Who can even in thought comprehend it   so a to utter a word about it But what in discourse do we mention more   familiarly and knowingly than time And we understand when we speak   of it we understand also when we hear it spoken of by another What   then is time If no one asks me I know if I wish to explain it to one   that asketh I know not yet I say boldly that I know that if nothing   passed away time past were not and if nothing were coming a time to   come were not and if nothing were time present were not Those two   time then past and to come how are they seeing the past now is   not and that to come is not yet But the present should it always be   present and never pas into time past verily it should not be time   but eternity If time present if it is to be time only cometh into   existence because it passeth into time past how can we say that either   this is whose cause of being is that it shall not be so namely that   we can not truly say that time is but because it is tending not to be     And yet we say a long time and a short time still only of time   past or to come A long time past for example we call an hundred year   since and a long time to come an hundred year hence But a short   time past we call suppose often day since and a short time to come   often day hence But in what sense is that long or short which is not   For the past is not now and the future is not yet Let u not then   say it is long but of the past it hath been long and of the   future it will be long O my Lord my Light shall not here also Thy   Truth mock at man For that past time which wa long wa it long when   it wa now past or when it wa yet present For then might it be long   when there wa what could be long but when past it wa no longer   wherefore neither could that be long which wa not at all Let u not   then say time past hath been long for we shall not find what hath   been long seeing that since it wa past it is no more but let u say   that present time wa long because when it wa present it wa long   For it had not yet passed away so a not to be and therefore there   wa what could be long but after it wa past that ceased also to be   long which ceased to be     Let u see then thou soul of man whether present time can be long   for to thee it is given to feel and to measure length of time What wilt   thou answer me Are an hundred year when present a long time See   first whether an hundred year can be present For if the first of   these year be now current it is present but the other ninety and   nine are to come and therefore are not yet but if the second year be   current one is now past another present the rest to come And so if   we assume any middle year of this hundred to be present all before it   are past all after it to come wherefore an hundred year can not be   present But see at least whether that one which is now current itself   is present for if the current month be it first the rest are to come   if the second the first is already past and the rest are not yet   Therefore neither is the year now current present and if not present   a a whole then is not the year present For twelve month are a year   of which whatever by the current month is present the rest past or to   come Although neither is that current month present but one day only   the rest being to come if it be the first past if the last if any of   the middle then amid past and to come     See how the present time which alone we found could be called long is   abridged to the length scarce of one day But let u examine that also   because neither is one day present a a whole For it is made up of four   and twenty hour of night and day of which the first hath the rest to   come the last hath them past and any of the middle hath those before   it past those behind it to come Yea that one hour passeth away in   flying particle Whatsoever of it hath flown away is past whatsoever   remaineth is to come If an instant of time be conceived which can not   be divided into the smallest particle of moment that alone is it   which may be called present Which yet fly with such speed from future   to past a not to be lengthened out with the least stay For if it be   it is divided into past and future The present hath no space Where   then is the time which we may call long Is it to come Of it we do not   say it is long because it is not yet so a to be long but we say   it will be long When therefore will it be For if even then when it   is yet to come it shall not be long because what can be long a yet   is not and so it shall then be long when from future which a yet is   not it shall begin now to be and have become present that so there   should exist what may be long then doe time present cry out in the   word above that it can not be long     And yet Lord we perceive interval of time and compare them and   say some are shorter and others longer We measure also how much   longer or shorter this time is than that and we answer This is   double or treble and that but once or only just so much a that   But we measure time a they are passing by perceiving them but past   which now are not or the future which are not yet who can measure   unless a man shall presume to say that can be measured which is not   When then time is passing it may be perceived and measured but when it   is past it can not because it is not     I ask Father I affirm not O my God rule and guide me Who will tell   me that there are not three time a we learned when boy and taught   boy past present and future but present only because those two   are not Or are they also and when from future it becometh present   doth it come out of some secret place and so when retiring from   present it becometh past For where did they who foretold thing to   come see them if a yet they be not For that which is not can not be   seen And they who relate thing past could not relate them if in mind   they did not discern them and if they were not they could no way be   discerned Things then past and to come are     Permit me Lord to seek further O my hope let not my purpose be   confounded For if time past and to come be I would know where they   be Which yet if I can not yet I know wherever they be they are not   there a future or past but present For if there also they be future   they are not yet there if there also they be past they are no longer   there Wheresoever then is whatsoever is it is only a present   Although when past fact are related there are drawn out of the memory   not the thing themselves which are past but word which conceived by   the image of the thing they in passing have through the sens left   a trace in the mind Thus my childhood which now is not is in time   past which now is not but now when I recall it image and tell of it   I behold it in the present because it is still in my memory Whether   there be a like cause of foretelling thing to come also that of   thing which a yet are not the image may be perceived before already   existing I confess O my God I know not This indeed I know that we   generally think before on our future action and that that forethinking   is present but the action whereof we forethink is not yet because it   is to come Which when we have set upon and have begun to do what   we were forethinking then shall that action be because then it is no   longer future but present     Which way soever then this secret foreperceiving of thing to come be   that only can be seen which is But what now is is not future   but present When then thing to come are said to be seen it is not   themselves which a yet are not that is which are to be but their   cause perchance or sign are seen which already are Therefore they   are not future but present to those who now see that from which   the future being foreconceived in the mind is foretold Which   foreconceptions again now are and those who foretell those thing do   behold the conception present before them Let now the numerous variety   of thing furnish me some example I behold the daybreak I foreshow   that the sun is about to rise What I behold is present what I   foresignify to come not the sun which already is but the sunrising   which is not yet And yet did I not in my mind imagine the sunrising   itself a now while I speak of it I could not foretell it But   neither is that daybreak which I discern in the sky the sunrising   although it go before it nor that imagination of my mind which two   are seen now present that the other which is to be may be foretold   Future thing then are not yet and if they be not yet they are not   and if they are not they can not be seen yet foretold they may be from   thing present which are already and are seen     Thou then Ruler of Thy creation by what way dost Thou teach soul   thing to come For Thou didst teach Thy Prophets By what way dost   Thou to whom nothing is to come teach thing to come or rather of the   future dost teach thing present For what is not neither can it be   taught Too far is this way of my ken it is too mighty for me I can not   attain unto it but from Thee I can when Thou shalt vouchsafe it O   sweet light of my hidden eye     What now is clear and plain is that neither thing to come nor past   are Nor is it properly said there be three time past present   and to come yet perchance it might be properly said there be three   time a present of thing past a present of thing present and a   present of thing future For these three do exist in some sort in the   soul but otherwhere do I not see them present of thing past memory   present of thing present sight present of thing future expectation   If thus we be permitted to speak I see three time and I confess there   are three Let it be said too there be three time past present and   to come in our incorrect way See I object not nor gainsay nor find   fault if what is so said be but understood that neither what is to be   now is nor what is past For but few thing are there which we   speak properly most thing improperly still the thing intended are   understood     I said then even now we measure time a they pas in order to be able   to say this time is twice so much a that one or this is just so   much a that and so of any other part of time which be measurable   Wherefore a I said we measure time a they pas And if any should   ask me How knowest thou I might answer I know that we do measure   nor can we measure thing that are not and thing past and to come are   not But time present how do we measure seeing it hath no space It   is measured while passing but when it shall have passed it is not   measured for there will be nothing to be measured But whence by what   way and whither pass it while it is a measuring whence but from the   future Which way but through the present whither but into the past   From that therefore which is not yet through that which hath no   space into that which now is not Yet what do we measure if not time   in some space For we do not say single and double and triple and   equal or any other like way that we speak of time except of space   of time In what space then do we measure time passing In the future   whence it passeth through But what is not yet we measure not Or in   the present by which it pass but no space we do not measure or in   the past to which it pass But neither do we measure that which now   is not     My soul is on fire to know this most intricate enigma Shut it not up O   Lord my God good Father through Christ I beseech Thee do not shut up   these usual yet hidden thing from my desire that it be hindered from   piercing into them but let them dawn through Thy enlightening mercy O   Lord Whom shall I enquire of concerning these thing and to whom shall   I more fruitfully confess my ignorance than to Thee to Whom these   my study so vehemently kindled toward Thy Scriptures are not   troublesome Give what I love for I do love and this hast Thou   given me Give Father Who truly knowest to give good gift unto Thy   child Give because I have taken upon me to know and trouble is   before me until Thou openest it By Christ I beseech Thee in His Name   Holy of holy let no man disturb me For I believed and therefore do   I speak This is my hope for this do I live that I may contemplate the   delight of the Lord Behold Thou hast made my day old and they pas   away and how I know not And we talk of time and time and time and   time How long time is it since he said this how long time since he   did this and how long time since I saw that and this syllable hath   double time to that single short syllable These word we speak and   these we hear and are understood and understand Most manifest and   ordinary they are and the selfsame thing again are but too deeply   hidden and the discovery of them were new     I heard once from a learned man that the motion of the sun moon   and star constituted time and I assented not For why should not   the motion of all body rather be time Or if the light of heaven   should cease and a potter wheel run round should there be no time   by which we might measure those whirling and say that either it   moved with equal pause or if it turned sometimes slower otherwhiles   quicker that some round were longer other shorter Or while we were   saying this should we not also be speaking in time Or should there   in our word be some syllable short others long but because those   sounded in a shorter time these in a longer God grant to men to see   in a small thing notice common to thing great and small The star and   light of heaven are also for sign and for season and for year   and for day they are yet neither should I say that the going round   of that wooden wheel wa a day nor yet he that it wa therefore no   time     I desire to know the force and nature of time by which we measure the   motion of body and say for example this motion is twice a long a   that For I ask Seeing day denotes not the stay only of the sun upon   the earth according to which day is one thing night another but also   it whole circuit from east to east again according to which we say   there passed so many day the night being included when we say so   many day and the night not reckoned apartseeing then a day is   completed by the motion of the sun and by his circuit from east to east   again I ask doe the motion alone make the day or the stay in which   that motion is completed or both For if the first be the day then   should we have a day although the sun should finish that course in so   small a space of time a one hour come to If the second then should   not that make a day if between one sunrise and another there were   but so short a stay a one hour come to but the sun must go four and   twenty time about to complete one day If both then neither could   that be called a day if the sun should run his whole round in the   space of one hour nor that if while the sun stood still so much   time should overpass a the sun usually make his whole course in from   morning to morning I will not therefore now ask what that is which is   called day but what time is whereby we measuring the circuit of the   sun should say that it wa finished in half the time it wa wo nt if   so be it wa finished in so small a space a twelve hour and comparing   both time should call this a single time that a double time even   supposing the sun to run his round from east to east sometimes in that   single sometimes in that double time Let no man then tell me that the   motion of the heavenly body constitute time because when at   the prayer of one the sun had stood still till he could achieve his   victorious battle the sun stood still but time went on For in it own   allotted space of time wa that battle waged and ended I perceive   time then to be a certain extension But do I perceive it or seem to   perceive it Thou Light and Truth wilt show me     Dost Thou bid me assent if any define time to be motion of a body   Thou dost not bid me For that no body is moved but in time I hear   this Thou sayest but that the motion of a body is time I hear not   Thou sayest it not For when a body is moved I by time measure how   long it moveth from the time it began to move until it left off And if   I did not see whence it began and it continue to move so that I see not   when it end I can not measure save perchance from the time I began   until I cease to see And if I look long I can only pronounce it to be   a long time but not how long because when we say how long we do   it by comparison a this is a long a that or twice so long a   that or the like But when we can mark the distance of the place   whence and whither goeth the body moved or his part if it moved a in   a lathe then can we say precisely in how much time the motion of   that body or his part from this place unto that wa finished Seeing   therefore the motion of a body is one thing that by which we measure   how long it is another who see not which of the two is rather to   be called time For and if a body be sometimes moved sometimes stand   still then we measure not his motion only but his standing still too   by time and we say it stood still a much a it moved or it stood   still twice or thrice so long a it moved or any other space which our   measuring hath either ascertained or guessed more or le a we use   to say Time then is not the motion of a body     And I confess to Thee O Lord that I yet know not what time is and   again I confess unto Thee O Lord that I know that I speak this in   time and that having long spoken of time that very long is not long   but by the pause of time How then know I this seeing I know not what   time is or is it perchance that I know not how to express what I know   Woe is me that do not even know what I know not Behold O my God   before Thee I lie not but a I speak so is my heart Thou shalt light   my candle Thou O Lord my God wilt enlighten my darkness     Does not my soul most truly confess unto Thee that I do measure time   Do I then measure O my God and know not what I measure I measure the   motion of a body in time and the time itself do I not measure Or could   I indeed measure the motion of a body how long it were and in how long   space it could come from this place to that without measuring the time   in which it is moved This same time then how do I measure do we by a   shorter time measure a longer a by the space of a cubit the space   of a rood for so indeed we seem by the space of a short syllable to   measure the space of a long syllable and to say that this is double   the other Thus measure we the space of stanza by the space of the   verse and the space of the verse by the space of the foot and the   space of the foot by the space of the syllable and the space of   long by the space of short syllable not measuring by page for then   we measure space not time but when we utter the word and they pas   by and we say it is a long stanza because composed of so many verse   long verse because consisting of so many foot long foot because   prolonged by so many syllable a long syllable because double to a   short one But neither do we this way obtain any certain measure of   time because it may be that a shorter verse pronounced more fully   may take up more time than a longer pronounced hurriedly And so for a   verse a foot a syllable Whence it seemed to me that time is nothing   else than protraction but of what I know not and I marvel if it   be not of the mind itself For what I beseech Thee O my God do I   measure when I say either indefinitely this is a longer time than   that or definitely this is double that That I measure time I know   and yet I measure not time to come for it is not yet nor present   because it is not protracted by any space nor past because it now is   not What then do I measure Times passing not past for so I said     Courage my mind and press on mightily God is our helper He made u   and not we ourselves Press on where truth begin to dawn Suppose now   the voice of a body begin to sound and doe sound and sound on and   list it cease it is silence now and that voice is past and is   no more a voice Before it sounded it wa to come and could not be   measured because a yet it wa not and now it can not because it is   no longer Then therefore while it sounded it might because there then   wa what might be measured But yet even then it wa not at a stay for   it wa passing on and passing away Could it be measured the rather   for that For while passing it wa being extended into some space of   time so that it might be measured since the present hath no space If   therefore then it might then lo suppose another voice hath begun   to sound and still soundeth in one continued tenor without any   interruption let u measure it while it sound seeing when it hath   left sounding it will then be past and nothing left to be measured   let u measure it verily and tell how much it is But it sound still   nor can it be measured but from the instant it began in unto the end   it left in For the very space between is the thing we measure namely   from some beginning unto some end Wherefore a voice that is not yet   ended can not be measured so that it may be said how long or short it   is nor can it be called equal to another or double to a single or the   like But when ended it no longer is How may it then be measured And   yet we measure time but yet neither those which are not yet nor those   which no longer are nor those which are not lengthened out by some   pause nor those which have no bound We measure neither time to come   nor past nor present nor passing and yet we do measure time     Deus Creator omnium this verse of eight syllable alternate between   short and long syllable The four short then the first third fifth   and seventh are but single in respect of the four long the second   fourth sixth and eighth Every one of these to every one of those   hath a double time I pronounce them report on them and find it so   a one plain sense perceives By plain sense then I measure a long   syllable by a short and I sensibly find it to have twice so much but   when one sound after the other if the former be short the latter   long how shall I detain the short one and how measuring shall I   apply it to the long that I may find this to have twice so much seeing   the long doe not begin to sound unless the short leaf sounding And   that very long one do I measure a present seeing I measure it not   till it be ended Now his ending is his passing away What then is it I   measure where is the short syllable by which I measure where the long   which I measure Both have sounded have flown passed away are no   more and yet I measure and confidently answer so far a is presumed   on a practised sense that a to space of time this syllable is but   single that double And yet I could not do this unless they were   already past and ended It is not then themselves which now are not   that I measure but something in my memory which there remains fixed     It is in thee my mind that I measure time Interrupt me not that   is interrupt not thyself with the tumult of thy impression In thee   I measure time the impression which thing a they pas by cause in   thee remains even when they are gone this it is which still present   I measure not the thing which pas by to make this impression This   I measure when I measure time Either then this is time or I do not   measure time What when we measure silence and say that this silence   hath held a long time a did that voice do we not stretch out our   thought to the measure of a voice a if it sounded that so we may be   able to report of the interval of silence in a given space of time For   though both voice and tongue be still yet in thought we go over poem   and verse and any other discourse or dimension of motion and   report a to the space of time how much this is in respect of that   no otherwise than if vocally we did pronounce them If a man would utter   a lengthened sound and had settled in thought how long it should be he   hath in silence already gone through a space of time and committing   it to memory begin to utter that speech which sound on until it be   brought unto the end proposed Yea it hath sounded and will sound for   so much of it a is finished hath sounded already and the rest will   sound And thus passeth it on until the present intent conveys over   the future into the past the past increasing by the diminution of the   future until by the consumption of the future all is past     But how is that future diminished or consumed which a yet is not or   how that past increased which is now no longer save that in the mind   which enacteth this there be three thing done For it expects it   considers it remembers that so that which it expecteth through   that which it considereth passeth into that which it remembereth Who   therefore denieth that thing to come are not a yet and yet there is   in the mind an expectation of thing to come And who denies past thing   to be now no longer and yet is there still in the mind a memory of   thing past And who denieth the present time hath no space because it   passeth away in a moment and yet our consideration continueth through   which that which shall be present proceedeth to become absent It is not   then future time that is long for a yet it is not but a long future   is a long expectation of the future nor is it time past which now is   not that is long but a long past is a long memory of the past     I am about to repeat a Psalm that I know Before I begin my expectation   is extended over the whole but when I have begun how much soever of   it I shall separate off into the past is extended along my memory thus   the life of this action of mine is divided between my memory a to what   I have repeated and expectation a to what I am about to repeat but   consideration is present with me that through it what wa future may   be conveyed over so a to become past Which the more it is done again   and again so much the more the expectation being shortened is the   memory enlarged till the whole expectation be at length exhausted when   that whole action being ended shall have passed into memory And this   which take place in the whole Psalm the same take place in each   several portion of it and each several syllable the same hold in that   longer action whereof this Psalm may be part the same hold in the   whole life of man whereof all the action of man are part the same   hold through the whole age of the son of men whereof all the life of   men are part     But because Thy lovingkindness is better than all life behold my   life is but a distraction and Thy right hand upheld me in my Lord the   Son of man the Mediator betwixt Thee The One and u many many also   through our manifold distraction amid many thing that by Him I may   apprehend in Whom I have been apprehended and may be recollected from   my old conversation to follow The One forgetting what is behind and   not distended but extended not to thing which shall be and shall   pas away but to those thing which are before not distractedly but   intently I follow on for the prize of my heavenly calling where I may   hear the voice of Thy praise and contemplate Thy delight neither   to come nor to pas away But now are my year spent in mourning And   Thou O Lord art my comfort my Father everlasting but I have been   severed amid time whose order I know not and my thought even   the inmost bowel of my soul are rent and mangled with tumultuous   variety until I flow together into Thee purified and molten by the   fire of Thy love     And now will I stand and become firm in Thee in my mould Thy truth   nor will I endure the question of men who by a penal disease thirst   for more than they can contain and say what did God before He made   heaven and earth Or How came it into His mind to make any thing   having never before made any thing Give them O Lord well to   bethink themselves what they say and to find that never can not be   predicated when time is not This then that He is said never to have   made what else is it to say than in no time to have made Let   them see therefore that time can not be without created being and cease   to speak that vanity May they also be extended towards those thing   which are before and understand Thee before all time the eternal   Creator of all time and that no time be coeternal with Thee nor any   creature even if there be any creature before all time     O Lord my God what a depth is that recess of Thy mystery and how far   from it have the consequence of my transgression cast me Heal mine   eye that I may share the joy of Thy light Certainly if there be mind   gifted with such vast knowledge and foreknowledge a to know all thing   past and to come a I know one wellknown Psalm truly that mind is   passing wonderful and fearfully amazing in that nothing past nothing   to come in afterages is any more hidden from him than when I sung   that Psalm wa hidden from me what and how much of it had passed away   from the beginning what and how much there remained unto the end But   far be it that Thou the Creator of the Universe the Creator of soul   and body far be it that Thou shouldest in such wise know all thing   past and to come Far far more wonderfully and far more mysteriously   dost Thou know them For not a the feeling of one who singeth what he   knoweth or heareth some wellknown song are through expectation of the   word to come and the remembering of those that are past varied   and his sens dividednot so doth any thing happen unto Thee   unchangeably eternal that is the eternal Creator of mind Like then   a Thou in the Beginning knewest the heaven and the earth without any   variety of Thy knowledge so madest Thou in the Beginning heaven and   earth without any distraction of Thy action Whoso understandeth let   him confess unto Thee and whoso understandeth not let him confess   unto Thee Oh how high art Thou and yet the humble in heart are Thy   dwellingplace for Thou raisest up those that are bowed down and they   fall not whose elevation Thou art           BOOK XII       My heart O Lord touched with the word of Thy Holy Scripture is much   busied amid this poverty of my life And therefore most time is the   poverty of human understanding copious in word because enquiring hath   more to say than discovering and demanding is longer than obtaining   and our hand that knock hath more work to do than our hand that   receives We hold the promise who shall make it null If God be for u   who can be against u Ask and ye shall have seek and ye shall find   knock and it shall be opened unto you For every one that asketh   receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh   shall it be opened These be Thine own promise and who need fear to be   deceived when the Truth promiseth     The lowliness of my tongue confesseth unto Thy Highness that Thou   madest heaven and earth this heaven which I see and this earth that I   tread upon whence is this earth that I bear about me Thou madest it   But where is that heaven of heaven O Lord which we hear of in the   word of the Psalm The heaven of heaven are the Lords but the earth   hath He given to the child of men Where is that heaven which we see   not to which all this which we see is earth For this corporeal whole   not being wholly every where hath in such wise received it portion of   beauty in these lower part whereof the lowest is this our earth but   to that heaven of heaven even the heaven of our earth is but earth   yea both these great body may not absurdly be called earth to that   unknown heaven which is the Lords not the son of men     And now this earth wa invisible and without form and there wa I know   not what depth of abyss upon which there wa no light because it had   no shape Therefore didst Thou command it to be written that darkness   wa upon the face of the deep what else than the absence of light For   had there been light where should it have been but by being over all   aloft and enlightening Where then light wa not what wa the presence   of darkness but the absence of light Darkness therefore wa upon it   because light wa not upon it a where sound is not there is silence   And what is it to have silence there but to have no sound there Hast   not Thou O Lord taught his soul which confesseth unto Thee Hast not   Thou taught me Lord that before Thou formedst and diversifiedst this   formless matter there wa nothing neither colour nor figure nor   body nor spirit and yet not altogether nothing for there wa a   certain formlessness without any beauty     How then should it be called that it might be in some measure conveyed   to those of duller mind but by some ordinary word And what among all   part of the world can be found nearer to an absolute formlessness than   earth and deep For occupying the lowest stage they are le beautiful   than the other higher part are transparent all and shining Wherefore   then may I not conceive the formlessness of matter which Thou hadst   created without beauty whereof to make this beautiful world to be   suitably intimated unto men by the name of earth invisible and without   form     So that when thought seeketh what the sense may conceive under this   and saith to itself It is no intellectual form a life or justice   because it is the matter of body nor object of sense because being   invisible and without form there wa in it no object of sight or   sensewhile man thought thus saith to itself it may endeavour   either to know it by being ignorant of it or to be ignorant by   knowing it     But I Lord if I would by my tongue and my pen confess unto Thee the   whole whatever Thyself hath taught me of that matterthe name whereof   hearing before and not understanding when they who understood it not   told me of it so I conceived of it a having innumerable form and   diverse and therefore did not conceive it at all my mind tossed up and   down foul and horrible form out of all order but yet form and I   called it without form not that it wanted all form but because it had   such a my mind would if presented to it turn from a unwonted and   jarring and human frailness would be troubled at And still that which   I conceived wa without form not a being deprived of all form but   in comparison of more beautiful form and true reason did persuade me   that I must utterly uncase it of all remnant of form whatsoever if   I would conceive matter absolutely without form and I could not for   sooner could I imagine that not to be at all which should be deprived   of all form than conceive a thing betwixt form and nothing neither   formed nor nothing a formless almost nothing So my mind gave over to   question thereupon with my spirit it being filled with the image of   formed body and changing and varying them a it willed and I bent   myself to the body themselves and looked more deeply into their   changeableness by which they cease to be what they have been and begin   to be what they were not and this same shifting from form to form I   suspected to be through a certain formless state not through a mere   nothing yet this I longed to know not to suspect onlyIf then my   voice and pen would confess unto Thee the whole whatsoever knot Thou   didst open for me in this question what reader would hold out to take   in the whole Nor shall my heart for all this cease to give Thee honour   and a song of praise for those thing which it is not able to express   For the changeableness of changeable thing is itself capable of all   those form into which these changeable thing are changed And this   changeableness what is it Is it soul Is it body Is it that which   constituteth soul or body Might one say a nothing something an   is is not I would say this were it and yet in some way wa it even   then a being capable of receiving these visible and compound figure     But whence had it this degree of being but from Thee from Whom are all   thing so far forth a they are But so much the further from Thee a   the unliker Thee for it is not farness of place Thou therefore   Lord Who art not one in one place and otherwise in another but the   Selfsame and the Selfsame and the Selfsame Holy Holy Holy Lord   God Almighty didst in the Beginning which is of Thee in Thy Wisdom   which wa born of Thine own Substance create something and that out of   nothing For Thou createdst heaven and earth not out of Thyself for so   should they have been equal to Thine Only Begotten Son and thereby to   Thee also whereas no way were it right that aught should be equal to   Thee which wa not of Thee And aught else besides Thee wa there not   whereof Thou mightest create them O God One Trinity and Trine Unity   and therefore out of nothing didst Thou create heaven and earth a great   thing and a small thing for Thou art Almighty and Good to make all   thing good even the great heaven and the petty earth Thou wert and   nothing wa there besides out of which Thou createdst heaven and earth   thing of two sort one near Thee the other near to nothing one to   which Thou alone shouldest be superior the other to which nothing   should be inferior     But that heaven of heaven wa for Thyself O Lord but the earth which   Thou gavest to the son of men to be seen and felt wa not such a we   now see and feel For it wa invisible without form and there wa a   deep upon which there wa no light or darkness wa above the deep   that is more than in the deep Because this deep of water visible   now hath even in his depth a light proper for it nature perceivable   in whatever degree unto the fish and creeping thing in the bottom   of it But that whole deep wa almost nothing because hitherto it   wa altogether without form yet there wa already that which could be   formed For Thou Lord madest the world of a matter without form which   out of nothing Thou madest next to nothing thereof to make those   great thing which we son of men wonder at For very wonderful is this   corporeal heaven of which firmament between water and water the second   day after the creation of light Thou saidst Let it be made and it   wa made Which firmament Thou calledst heaven the heaven that is to   this earth and sea which Thou madest the third day by giving a visible   figure to the formless matter which Thou madest before all day For   already hadst Thou made both an heaven before all day but that wa   the heaven of this heaven because In the beginning Thou hadst made   heaven and earth But this same earth which Thou madest wa formless   matter because it wa invisible and without form and darkness wa   upon the deep of which invisible earth and without form of which   formlessness of which almost nothing Thou mightest make all these   thing of which this changeable world consists but subsists not whose   very changeableness appears therein that time can be observed and   numbered in it For time are made by the alteration of thing while   the figure the matter whereof is the invisible earth aforesaid are   varied and turned     And therefore the Spirit the Teacher of Thy servant when It recount   Thee to have In the Beginning created heaven and earth speaks nothing   of time nothing of day For verily that heaven of heaven which   Thou createdst in the Beginning is some intellectual creature which   although no way coeternal unto Thee the Trinity yet partaketh of   Thy eternity and doth through the sweetness of that most happy   contemplation of Thyself strongly restrain it own changeableness and   without any fall since it first creation cleaving close unto Thee is   placed beyond all the rolling vicissitude of time Yea neither is this   very formlessness of the earth invisible and without form numbered   among the day For where no figure nor order is there doe nothing   come or go and where this is not there plainly are no day nor any   vicissitude of space of time     O let the Light the Truth the Light of my heart not mine own   darkness speak unto me I fell off into that and became darkened but   even thence even thence I loved Thee I went astray and remembered   Thee I heard Thy voice behind me calling to me to return and scarcely   heard it through the tumultuousness of the enemy of peace And now   behold I return in distress and panting after Thy fountain Let no man   forbid me of this will I drink and so live Let me not be mine own   life from myself I lived ill death wa I to myself and I revive in   Thee Do Thou speak unto me do Thou discourse unto me I have believed   Thy Books and their word be most full of mystery     Already Thou hast told me with a strong voice O Lord in my inner ear   that Thou art eternal Who only hast immortality since Thou canst not   be changed a to figure or motion nor is Thy will altered by time   seeing no will which varies is immortal This is in Thy sight clear to   me and let it be more and more cleared to me I beseech Thee and in   the manifestation thereof let me with sobriety abide under Thy wing   Thou hast told me also with a strong voice O Lord in my inner ear   that Thou hast made all nature and substance which are not what   Thyself is and yet are and that only is not from Thee which is not   and the motion of the will from Thee who art unto that which in a le   degree is because such motion is transgression and sin and that no   man sin doth either hurt Thee or disturb the order of Thy government   first or last This is in Thy sight clear unto me and let it be   more and more cleared to me I beseech Thee and in the manifestation   thereof let me with sobriety abide under Thy wing     Thou hast told me also with a strong voice in my inner ear that   neither is that creature coeternal unto Thyself whose happiness   Thou only art and which with a most persevering purity drawing it   nourishment from Thee doth in no place and at no time put forth it   natural mutability and Thyself being ever present with it unto Whom   with it whole affection it keep itself having neither future to   expect nor conveying into the past what it remembereth is neither   altered by any change nor distracted into any time O blessed   creature if such there be for cleaving unto Thy Blessedness blest in   Thee it eternal Inhabitant and it Enlightener Nor do I find by what   name I may the rather call the heaven of heaven which is the Lords   than Thine house which contemplateth Thy delight without any defection   of going forth to another one pure mind most harmoniously one by that   settled estate of peace of holy spirit the citizen of Thy city in   heavenly place far above those heavenly place that we see     By this may the soul whose pilgrimage is made long and far away by   this may she understand if she now thirst for Thee if her tear be   now become her bread while they daily say unto her Where is Thy God   if she now seek of Thee one thing and desireth it that she may dwell   in Thy house all the day of her life and what is her life but Thou   and what Thy day but Thy eternity a Thy year which fail not   because Thou art ever the same by this then may the soul that is   able understand how far Thou art above all time eternal seeing   Thy house which at no time went into a far country although it be not   coeternal with Thee yet by continually and unfailingly cleaving unto   Thee suffers no changeableness of time This is in Thy sight clear   unto me and let it be more and more cleared unto me I beseech Thee   and in the manifestation thereof let me with sobriety abide under Thy   wing     There is behold I know not what formlessness in those change of these   last and lowest creature and who shall tell me unless such a one a   through the emptiness of his own heart wonder and toss himself up   and down amid his own fancy who but such a one would tell me that   if all figure be so wasted and consumed away that there should only   remain that formlessness through which the thing wa changed and turned   from one figure to another that that could exhibit the vicissitude   of time For plainly it could not because without the variety of   motion there are no time and no variety where there is no figure     These thing considered a much a Thou givest O my God a much   a Thou stirrest me up to knock and a much a Thou openest to me   knocking two thing I find that Thou hast made not within the compass   of time neither of which is coeternal with Thee One which is so   formed that without any ceasing of contemplation without any interval   of change though changeable yet not changed it may thoroughly enjoy   Thy eternity and unchangeableness the other which wa so formless   that it had not that which could be changed from one form into another   whether of motion or of repose so a to become subject unto time But   this Thou didst not leave thus formless because before all day Thou   in the Beginning didst create Heaven and Earth the two thing that I   spake of But the Earth wa invisible and without form and darkness   wa upon the deep In which word is the formlessness conveyed unto u   that such capacity may hereby be drawn on by degree a are not   able to conceive an utter privation of all form without yet coming to   nothing out of which another Heaven might be created together with   a visible and wellformed earth and the water diversly ordered and   whatsoever further is in the formation of the world recorded to have   been not without day created and that a being of such nature that   the successive change of time may take place in them a being subject   to appointed alteration of motion and of form     This then is what I conceive O my God when I hear Thy Scripture   saying In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth and the Earth wa   invisible and without form and darkness wa upon the deep and not   mentioning what day Thou createdst them this is what I conceive that   because of the Heaven of heavensthat intellectual Heaven whose   Intelligences know all at once not in part not darkly not through a   glass but a a whole in manifestation face to face not this thing   now and that thing anon but a I said know all at once without any   succession of timesand because of the earth invisible and without   form without any succession of time which succession present this   thing now that thing anon because where is no form there is   no distinction of thingsit is then on account of these two a   primitive formed and a primitive formless the one heaven but the   Heaven of heaven the other earth but the earth invisible and without   form because of these two do I conceive did Thy Scripture say without   mention of day In the Beginning God created Heaven and Earth For   forthwith it subjoined what earth it spake of and also in that the   Firmament is recorded to be created the second day and called Heaven   it conveys to u of which Heaven He before spake without mention of   day     Wondrous depth of Thy word whose surface behold is before u   inviting to little one yet are they a wondrous depth O my God a   wondrous depth It is awful to look therein an awfulness of honour and   a trembling of love The enemy thereof I hate vehemently oh that Thou   wouldest slay them with Thy twoedged sword that they might no longer   be enemy unto it for so do I love to have them slain unto themselves   that they may live unto Thee But behold others not faultfinder but   extoller of the book of Genesis The Spirit of God say they Who   by His servant Moses wrote these thing would not have those word   thus understood He would not have it understood a thou sayest but   otherwise a we say Unto Whom Thyself O Thou God all being judge   do I thus answer     Will you affirm that to be false which with a strong voice Truth tell   me in my inner ear concerning the Eternity of the Creator that His   substance is no way changed by time nor His will separate from His   substance Wherefore He willeth not one thing now another anon but   once and at once and always He willeth all thing that He willeth   not again and again nor now this now that nor willeth afterwards   what before He willed not nor willeth not what before He willed   because such a will is and no mutable thing is eternal but our God is   eternal Again what He tell me in my inner ear the expectation of   thing to come becomes sight when they are come and this same sight   becomes memory when they be past Now all thought which thus varies is   mutable and no mutable thing is eternal but our God is eternal These   thing I infer and put together and find that my God the eternal God   hath not upon any new will made any creature nor doth His knowledge   admit of any thing transitory What will ye say then O ye gainsayers   Are these thing false No they say What then Is it false that   every nature already formed or matter capable of form is not but from   Him Who is supremely good because He is supremely Neither do we deny   this say they What then do you deny this that there is a certain   sublime creature with so chaste a love cleaving unto the true and   truly eternal God that although not coeternal with Him yet is it not   detached from Him nor dissolved into the variety and vicissitude of   time but reposeth in the most true contemplation of Him only Because   Thou O God unto him that loveth Thee so much a Thou commandest dost   show Thyself and sufficest him and therefore doth he not decline   from Thee nor toward himself This is the house of God not of earthly   mould nor of celestial bulk corporeal but spiritual and partaker of   Thy eternity because without defection for ever For Thou hast made   it fast for ever and ever Thou hast given it a law which it shall not   pas Nor yet is it coeternal with Thee O God because not without   beginning for it wa made     For although we find no time before it for wisdom wa created before   all thing not that Wisdom which is altogether equal and coeternal unto   Thee our God His Father and by Whom all thing were created and in   Whom a the Beginning Thou createdst heaven and earth but that   wisdom which is created that is the intellectual nature which by   contemplating the light is light For this though created is also   called wisdom But what difference there is betwixt the Light which   enlighteneth and which is enlightened so much is there betwixt the   Wisdom that createth and that created a betwixt the Righteousness   which justifieth and the righteousness which is made by justification   For we also are called Thy righteousness for so saith a certain   servant of Thine That we might be made the righteousness of God in Him   Therefore since a certain created wisdom wa created before all thing   the rational and intellectual mind of that chaste city of Thine our   mother which is above and is free and eternal in the heaven in   what heaven if not in those that praise Thee the Heaven of heaven   Because this is also the Heaven of heaven for the Lordthough we   find no time before it because that which hath been created before all   thing precedeth also the creature of time yet is the Eternity of   the Creator Himself before it from Whom being created it took the   beginning not indeed of time for time itself wa not yet but of it   creation     Hence it is so of Thee our God a to be altogether other than Thou   and not the Selfsame because though we find time neither before it   nor even in it it being meet ever to behold Thy face nor is ever drawn   away from it wherefore it is not varied by any change yet is there in   it a liability to change whence it would wax dark and chill but   that by a strong affection cleaving unto Thee like perpetual noon it   shineth and gloweth from Thee O house most lightsome and delightsome   I have loved thy beauty and the place of the habitation of the glory   of my Lord thy builder and possessor Let my wayfaring sigh after thee   and I say to Him that made thee let Him take possession of me also in   thee seeing He hath made me likewise I have gone astray like a lost   sheep yet upon the shoulder of my Shepherd thy builder hope I to be   brought back to thee     What say ye to me O ye gainsayers that I wa speaking unto who yet   believe Moses to have been the holy servant of God and his book the   oracle of the Holy Ghost Is not this house of God not coeternal   indeed with God yet after it measure eternal in the heaven when you   seek for change of time in vain because you will not find them For   that to which it is ever good to cleave fast to God surpasses all   extension and all revolving period of time It is say they   What then of all that which my heart loudly uttered unto my God when   inwardly it heard the voice of His praise what part thereof do you   affirm to be false Is it that the matter wa without form in which   because there wa no form there wa no order But where no order wa   there could be no vicissitude of time and yet this almost nothing   inasmuch a it wa not altogether nothing wa from Him certainly from   Whom is whatsoever is in what degree soever it is This also say   they do we not deny     With these I now parley a little in Thy presence O my God who grant   all these thing to be true which Thy Truth whisper unto my soul For   those who deny these thing let them bark and deafen themselves a much   a they please I will essay to persuade them to quiet and to open in   them a way for Thy word But if they refuse and repel me I beseech O   my God be not Thou silent to me Speak Thou truly in my heart for   only Thou so speakest and I will let them alone blowing upon the dust   without and raising it up into their own eye and myself will enter   my chamber and sing there a song of love unto Thee groaning with   groanings unutterable in my wayfaring and remembering Jerusalem with   heart lifted up towards it Jerusalem my country Jerusalem my mother   and Thyself that rulest over it the Enlightener Father Guardian   Husband the pure and strong delight and solid joy and all good thing   unspeakable yea all at once because the One Sovereign and true Good   Nor will I be turned away until Thou gather all that I am from this   dispersed and disordered estate into the peace of that our most dear   mother where the firstfruits of my spirit be already whence I am   ascertained of these thing and Thou conform and confirm it for ever   O my God my Mercy But those who do not affirm all these truth to be   false who honour Thy holy Scripture set forth by holy Moses placing   it a we on the summit of authority to be followed and do yet   contradict me in some thing I answer thus By Thyself judge O our God   between my Confessions and these men contradiction     For they say Though these thing be true yet did not Moses intend   those two when by revelation of the Spirit he said In the beginning   God created heaven and earth He did not under the name of heaven   signify that spiritual or intellectual creature which always beholds the   face of God nor under the name of earth that formless matter What   then That man of God say they meant a we say this declared he   by those word What By the name of heaven and earth would he first   signify say they universally and compendiously all this visible   world so a afterwards by the enumeration of the several day to   arrange in detail and a it were piece by piece all those thing   which it pleased the Holy Ghost thus to enounce For such were that   rude and carnal people to which he spake that he thought them fit to be   entrusted with the knowledge of such work of God only a were visible   They agree however that under the word earth invisible and without   form and that darksome deep out of which it is subsequently shown   that all these visible thing which we all know were made and arranged   during those day may not incongruously be understood of this   formless first matter     What now if another should say that this same formlessness and   confusedness of matter wa for this reason first conveyed under the   name of heaven and earth because out of it wa this visible world with   all those nature which most manifestly appear in it which is ofttimes   called by the name of heaven and earth created and perfected What   again if another say that invisible and visible nature is not indeed   inappropriately called heaven and earth and so that the universal   creation which God made in His Wisdom that is in the Beginning wa   comprehended under those two word Notwithstanding since all thing be   made not of the substance of God but out of nothing because they are   not the same that God is and there is a mutable nature in them all   whether they abide a doth the eternal house of God or be changed a   the soul and body of man are therefore the common matter of all thing   visible and invisible a yet unformed though capable of form out of   which wa to be created both heaven and earth ie the invisible and   visible creature when formed wa entitled by the same name given to   the earth invisible and without form and the darkness upon the deep but   with this distinction that by the earth invisible and without form is   understood corporeal matter antecedent to it being qualified by any   form and by the darkness upon the deep spiritual matter before it   underwent any restraint of it unlimited fluidness or received any   light from Wisdom     It yet remains for a man to say if he will that the already perfected   and formed nature visible and invisible are not signified under the   name of heaven and earth when we read In the beginning God made heaven   and earth but that the yet unformed commencement of thing the stuff   apt to receive form and making wa called by these name because   therein were confusedly contained not a yet distinguished by their   quality and form all those thing which being now digested into   order are called Heaven and Earth the one being the spiritual the   other the corporeal creation     All which thing being heard and well considered I will not strive   about word for that is profitable to nothing but the subversion of   the hearer But the law is good to edify if a man use it lawfully for   that the end of it is charity out of a pure heart and good conscience   and faith unfeigned And well did our Master know upon which two   commandment He hung all the Law and the Prophets And what doth it   prejudice me O my God Thou light of my eye in secret zealously   confessing these thing since diver thing may be understood under   these word which yet are all truewhat I say doth it prejudice me   if I think otherwise than another thinketh the writer thought All we   reader verily strive to trace out and to understand his meaning whom we   read and seeing we believe him to speak truly we dare not imagine   him to have said any thing which ourselves either know or think to   be false While every man endeavour then to understand in the Holy   Scriptures the same a the writer understood what hurt is it if a man   understand what Thou the light of all truespeaking mind dost show   him to be true although he whom he read understood not this seeing   he also understood a Truth though not this truth     For true it is O Lord that Thou madest heaven and earth and it is   true too that the Beginning is Thy Wisdom in Which Thou createst all   and true again that this visible world hath for it greater part   the heaven and the earth which briefly comprise all made and created   nature And true too that whatsoever is mutable give u to   understand a certain want of form whereby it receiveth a form or is   changed or turned It is true that that is subject to no time which   so cleaveth to the unchangeable Form a though subject to change   never to be changed It is true that that formlessness which is almost   nothing can not be subject to the alteration of time It is true that   that whereof a thing is made may by a certain mode of speech be called   by the name of the thing made of it whence that formlessness whereof   heaven and earth were made might be called heaven and earth It is   true that of thing having form there is not any nearer to having   no form than the earth and the deep It is true that not only every   created and formed thing but whatsoever is capable of being created and   formed Thou madest of Whom are all thing It is true that whatsoever   is formed out of that which had no form wa unformed before it wa   formed     Out of these truth of which they doubt not whose inward eye Thou hast   enabled to see such thing and who unshakenly believe Thy servant Moses   to have spoken in the Spirit of truthof all these then he taketh   one who saith In the Beginning God made the heaven and the earth that   is in His Word coeternal with Himself God made the intelligible and   the sensible or the spiritual and the corporeal creature He another   that saith In the Beginning God made heaven and earth that is in   His Word coeternal with Himself did God make the universal bulk of this   corporeal world together with all those apparent and known creature   which it containeth He another that saith In the Beginning God made   heaven and earth that is in His Word coeternal with Himself did   God make the formless matter of creature spiritual and corporeal He   another that saith In the Beginning God created heaven and earth that   is in His Word coeternal with Himself did God create the formless   matter of the creature corporeal wherein heaven and earth lay a yet   confused which being now distinguished and formed we at this day see   in the bulk of this world He another who saith In the Beginning God   made heaven and earth that is in the very beginning of creating and   working did God make that formless matter confusedly containing in   itself both heaven and earth out of which being formed do they now   stand out and are apparent with all that is in them     And with regard to the understanding of the word following out of all   those truth he chooses one to himself who saith But the earth wa   invisible and without form and darkness wa upon the deep that is   that corporeal thing that God made wa a yet a formless matter of   corporeal thing without order without light Another he who say   The earth wa invisible and without form and darkness wa upon the   deep that is this all which is called heaven and earth wa still   a formless and darksome matter of which the corporeal heaven and the   corporeal earth were to be made with all thing in them which are   known to our corporeal sens Another he who say The earth wa   invisible and without form and darkness wa upon the deep that is   this all which is called heaven and earth wa still a formless and   a darksome matter out of which wa to be made both that intelligible   heaven otherwhere called the Heaven of heaven and the earth that is   the whole corporeal nature under which name is comprised this corporeal   heaven also in a word out of which every visible and invisible   creature wa to be created Another he who say The earth wa   invisible and without form and darkness wa upon the deep the   Scripture did not call that formlessness by the name of heaven and   earth but that formlessness saith he already wa which he called the   earth invisible without form and darkness upon the deep of which   he had before said that God had made heaven and earth namely the   spiritual and corporeal creature Another he who say The earth wa   invisible and without form and darkness wa upon the deep that is   there already wa a certain formless matter of which the Scripture   said before that God made heaven and earth namely the whole corporeal   bulk of the world divided into two great part upper and lower with   all the common and known creature in them     For should any attempt to dispute against these two last opinion thus   If you will not allow that this formlessness of matter seems to be   called by the name of heaven and earth Ergo there wa something which   God had not made out of which to make heaven and earth for neither   hath Scripture told u that God made this matter unless we understand   it to be signified by the name of heaven and earth or of earth alone   when it is said In the Beginning God made the heaven and earth that so   in what follows and the earth wa invisible and without form although   it pleased Him so to call the formless matter we are to understand   no other matter but that which God made whereof is written above God   made heaven and earth The maintainer of either of those two latter   opinion will upon hearing this return for answer we do not deny   this formless matter to be indeed created by God that God of Whom are   all thing very good for a we affirm that to be a greater good which   is created and formed so we confess that to be a lesser good which is   made capable of creation and form yet still good We say however that   Scripture hath not set down that God made this formlessness a also it   hath not many others a the Cherubim and Seraphim and those which   the Apostle distinctly speaks of Thrones Dominions Principalities   Powers All which that God made is most apparent Or if in that which   is said He made heaven and earth all thing be comprehended what   shall we say of the water upon which the Spirit of God moved For if   they be comprised in this word earth how then can formless matter be   meant in that name of earth when we see the water so beautiful Or   if it be so taken why then is it written that out of the same   formlessness the firmament wa made and called heaven and that the   water were made is not written For the water remain not formless and   invisible seeing we behold them flowing in so comely a manner But if   they then received that beauty when God said Let the water under the   firmament be gathered together that so the gathering together be itself   the forming of them what will be said a to those water above the   firmament Seeing neither if formless would they have been worthy of so   honourable a seat nor is it written by what word they were formed If   then Genesis is silent a to Gods making of any thing which yet   that God did make neither sound faith nor wellgrounded understanding   doubteth nor again will any sober teaching dare to affirm these   water to be coeternal with God on the ground that we find them to be   mentioned in the hook of Genesis but when they were created we do   not find why seeing truth teach u should we not understand that   formless matter which this Scripture call the earth invisible and   without form and darksome deep to have been created of God out of   nothing and therefore not to be coeternal to Him notwithstanding this   history hath omitted to show when it wa created     These thing then being heard and perceived according to the weakness   of my capacity which I confess unto Thee O Lord that knowest it two   sort of disagreement I see may arise when a thing is in word related   by true reporter one concerning the truth of the thing the other   concerning the meaning of the relater For we enquire one way about   the making of the creature what is true another way what Moses   that excellent minister of Thy Faith would have his reader and hearer   understand by those word For the first sort away with all those   who imagine themselves to know a a truth what is false and for this   other away with all them too which imagine Moses to have written   thing that be false But let me be united in Thee O Lord with those   and delight myself in Thee with them that feed on Thy truth in the   largeness of charity and let u approach together unto the word of   Thy book and seek in them for Thy meaning through the meaning of Thy   servant by whose pen Thou hast dispensed them     But which of u shall among those so many truth which occur to   enquirer in those word a they are differently understood so   discover that one meaning a to affirm this Moses thought and this   would he have understood in that history with the same confidence   a he would this is true whether Moses thought this or that For   behold O my God I Thy servant who have in this book vowed a sacrifice   of confession unto Thee and pray that by Thy mercy I may pay my vow   unto Thee can I with the same confidence wherewith I affirm that in   Thy incommutable world Thou createdst all thing visible and invisible   affirm also that Moses meant no other than this when he wrote In the   Beginning God made heaven and earth No Because I see not in his mind   that he thought of this when he wrote these thing a I do see it   in Thy truth to be certain For he might have his thought upon Gods   commencement of creating when he said In the beginning and by heaven   and earth in this place he might intend no formed and perfected nature   whether spiritual or corporeal but both of them inchoate and a yet   formless For I perceive that whichsoever of the two had been said it   might have been truly said but which of the two he thought of in these   word I do not so perceive Although whether it were either of these   or any sense beside that I have not here mentioned which this so   great man saw in his mind when he uttered these word I doubt not but   that he saw it truly and expressed it aptly     Let no man harass me then by saying Moses thought not a you say but   a I say for if he should ask me How know you that Moses thought that   which you infer out of his word I ought to take it in good part and   would answer perchance a I have above or something more at large if   he were unyielding But when he saith Moses meant not what you say   but what I say yet denieth not that what each of u say may both be   true O my God life of the poor in Whose bosom is no contradiction   pour down a softening dew into my heart that I may patiently bear with   such a say this to me not because they have a divine Spirit and have   seen in the heart of Thy servant what they speak but because they be   proud not knowing Moses opinion but loving their own not because it   is truth but because it is theirs Otherwise they would equally love   another true opinion a I love what they say when they say true not   because it is theirs but because it is true and on that very ground   not theirs because it is true But if they therefore love it because   it is true then is it both theirs and mine a being in common to all   lover of truth But whereas they contend that Moses did not mean what   I say but what they say this I like not love not for though it   were so yet that their rashness belongs not to knowledge but to   overboldness and not insight but vanity wa it parent And therefore   O Lord are Thy judgement terrible seeing Thy truth is neither mine   nor his nor anothers but belonging to u all whom Thou callest   publicly to partake of it warning u terribly not to account   it private to ourselves lest we be deprived of it For whosoever   challenge that a proper to himself which Thou propoundest to all to   enjoy and would have that his own which belongs to all is driven from   what is in common to his own that is from truth to a lie For he that   speaketh a lie speaketh it of his own     Hearken O God Thou best judge Truth Itself hearken to what I shall   say to this gainsayer hearken for before Thee do I speak and before   my brother who employ Thy law lawfully to the end of charity   hearken and behold if it please Thee what I shall say to him For this   brotherly and peaceful word do I return unto Him If we both see that   to be true that Thou sayest and both see that to be true that I say   where I pray Thee do we see it Neither I in thee nor thou in me but   both in the unchangeable Truth itself which is above our soul Seeing   then we strive not about the very light of the Lord God why strive   we about the thought of our neighbour which we can not so see a the   unchangeable Truth is seen for that if Moses himself had appeared to   u and said This I meant neither so should we see it but should   believe it Let u not then be puffed up for one against another above   that which is written let u love the Lord our God with all our heart   with all our soul and with all our mind and our neighbour a ourself   With a view to which two precept of charity unless we believe that   Moses meant whatsoever in those book he did mean we shall make God   a liar imagining otherwise of our fellow servant mind than he hath   taught u Behold now how foolish it is in such abundance of most   true meaning a may be extracted out of those word rashly to affirm   which of them Moses principally meant and with pernicious contention   to offend charity itself for whose sake he spake every thing whose   word we go about to expound     And yet I O my God Thou lifter up of my humility and rest of my   labour Who hearest my confession and forgivest my sin seeing Thou   commandest me to love my neighbour a myself I can not believe that Thou   gavest a le gift unto Moses Thy faithful servant than I would wish   or desire Thee to have given me had I been born in the time he wa and   hadst Thou set me in that office that by the service of my heart and   tongue those book might be dispensed which for so long after were to   profit all nation and through the whole world from such an eminence of   authority were to surmount all saying of false and proud teaching I   should have desired verily had I then been Moses for we all come from   the same lump and what is man saving that Thou art mindful of him   I would then had I been then what he wa and been enjoined by Thee to   write the book of Genesis have desired such a power of expression and   such a style to be given me that neither they who can not yet understand   how God created might reject the saying a beyond their capacity and   they who had attained thereto might find what true opinion soever they   had by thought arrived at not passed over in those few word of   that Thy servant and should another man by the light of truth have   discovered another neither should that fail of being discoverable in   those same word     For a a fountain within a narrow compass is more plentiful and   supply a tide for more stream over larger space than any one of   those stream which after a wide interval is derived from the same   fountain so the relation of that dispenser of Thine which wa to   benefit many who were to discourse thereon doe out of a narrow   scantling of language overflow into stream of clearest truth whence   every man may draw out for himself such truth a he can upon these   subject one one truth another another by larger circumlocution of   discourse For some when they read or hear these word conceive that   God like a man or some mass endued with unbounded power by some new   and sudden resolution did exterior to itself a it were at a certain   distance create heaven and earth two great body above and below   wherein all thing were to be contained And when they hear God said   Let it be made and it wa made they conceive of word begun and ended   sounding in time and passing away after whose departure that came   into being which wa commanded so to do and whatever of the like sort   men acquaintance with the material world would suggest In whom being   yet little one and carnal while their weakness is by this humble   kind of speech carried on a in a mother bosom their faith is   wholesomely built up whereby they hold assured that God made all   nature which in admirable variety their eye beholdeth around Which   word if any despising a too simple with a proud weakness shall   stretch himself beyond the guardian nest he will ala fall miserably   Have pity O Lord God lest they who go by the way trample on the   unfledged bird and send Thine angel to replace it into the nest that   it may live till it can fly     But others unto whom these word are no longer a nest but deep shady   fruitbowers see the fruit concealed therein fly joyously around   and with cheerful note seek out and pluck them For reading or hearing   these word they see that all time past and to come are surpassed by   Thy eternal and stable abiding and yet that there is no creature formed   in time not of Thy making Whose will because it is the same that Thou   art Thou madest all thing not by any change of will nor by a will   which before wa not and that these thing were not out of Thyself in   Thine own likeness which is the form of all thing but out of nothing   a formless unlikeness which should be formed by Thy likeness recurring   to Thy Unity according to their appointed capacity so far a is given   to each thing in his kind and might all be made very good whether   they abide around Thee or being in gradation removed in time and place   made or undergo the beautiful variation of the Universe These thing   they see and rejoice in the little degree they here may in the light   of Thy truth     Another bend his mind on that which is said In the Beginning God made   heaven and earth and beholdeth therein Wisdom the Beginning because   It also speaketh unto u Another likewise bend his mind on the same   word and by Beginning understands the commencement of thing created   In the beginning He made a if it were said He at first made And   among them that understand In the Beginning to mean In Thy Wisdom Thou   createdst heaven and earth one belief the matter out of which the   heaven and earth were to be created to be there called heaven and   earth another nature already formed and distinguished another one   formed nature and that a spiritual under the name Heaven the other   formless a corporeal matter under the name Earth They again who by   the name heaven and earth understand matter a yet formless out of   which heaven and earth were to be formed neither do they understand it   in one way but the one that matter out of which both the intelligible   and the sensible creature were to be perfected another that only out   of which this sensible corporeal mass wa to be made containing in   it vast bosom these visible and ordinary nature Neither do they who   believe the creature already ordered and arranged to be in this place   called heaven and earth understand the same but the one both the   invisible and visible the other the visible only in which we behold   this lightsome heaven and darksome earth with the thing in them   contained     But he that no otherwise understands In the Beginning He made than if   it were said At first He made can only truly understand heaven and   earth of the matter of heaven and earth that is of the universal   intelligible and corporeal creation For if he would understand thereby   the universe a already formed it may be rightly demanded of him If   God made this first what made He afterwards and after the universe   he will find nothing whereupon must he against his will hear another   question How did God make this first if nothing after But when   he say God made matter first formless then formed there is no   absurdity if he be but qualified to discern what precedes by eternity   what by time what by choice and what in original By eternity a   God is before all thing by time a the flower before the fruit by   choice a the fruit before the flower by original a the sound before   the tune Of these four the first and last mentioned are with extreme   difficulty understood the two middle easily For a rare and too lofty   a vision is it to behold Thy Eternity O Lord unchangeably making   thing changeable and thereby before them And who again is of   so sharpsighted understanding a to be able without great pain to   discern how the sound is therefore before the tune because a tune is   a formed sound and a thing not formed may exist whereas that which   existeth not can not be formed Thus is the matter before the thing   made not because it maketh it seeing itself is rather made nor is it   before by interval of time for we do not first in time utter formless   sound without singing and subsequently adapt or fashion them into   the form of a chant a wood or silver whereof a chest or vessel is   fashioned For such material do by time also precede the form of the   thing made of them but in singing it is not so for when it is sung   it sound is heard for there is not first a formless sound which is   afterwards formed into a chant For each sound so soon a made passeth   away nor canst thou find ought to recall and by art to compose So   then the chant is concentrated in it sound which sound of his is his   matter And this indeed is formed that it may be a tune and therefore   a I said the matter of the sound is before the form of the tune not   before through any power it hath to make it a tune for a sound is no   way the workmaster of the tune but is something corporeal subjected to   the soul which singeth whereof to make a tune Nor is it first in time   for it is given forth together with the tune nor first in choice for   a sound is not better than a tune a tune being not only a sound but   a beautiful sound But it is first in original because a tune receives   not form to become a sound but a sound receives a form to become a   tune By this example let him that is able understand how the matter   of thing wa first made and called heaven and earth because heaven   and earth were made out of it Yet wa it not made first in time   because the form of thing give rise to time but that wa without   form but now is in time an object of sense together with it form   And yet nothing can be related of that matter but a though prior in   time whereas in value it is last because thing formed are superior   to thing without form and is preceded by the Eternity of the Creator   that so there might be out of nothing whereof somewhat might be   created     In this diversity of the true opinion let Truth herself produce   concord And our God have mercy upon u that we may use the law   lawfully the end of the commandment pure charity By this if man   demand of me which of these wa the meaning of Thy servant Moses   this were not the language of my Confessions should I not confess unto   Thee I know not and yet I know that those sens are true those   carnal one excepted of which I have spoken what seemed necessary And   even those hopeful little one who so think have this benefit that the   word of Thy Book affright them not delivering high thing lowlily   and with few word a copious meaning And all we who I confess see and   express the truth delivered in those word let u love one another and   jointly love Thee our God the fountain of truth if we are athirst for   it and not for vanity yea let u so honour this Thy servant the   dispenser of this Scripture full of Thy Spirit a to believe that   when by Thy revelation he wrote these thing he intended that which   among them chiefly excels both for light of truth and fruitfulness of   profit     So when one say Moses meant a I do and another Nay but a I   do I suppose that I speak more reverently Why not rather a both   if both be true And if there be a third or a fourth yea if any other   seeth any other truth in those word why may not he be believed to   have seen all these through whom the One God hath tempered the holy   Scriptures to the sens of many who should see therein thing true but   diver For I certainly and fearlessly I speak it from my heart that   were I to indite any thing to have supreme authority I should prefer   so to write that whatever truth any could apprehend on those matter   might be conveyed in my word rather than set down my own meaning so   clearly a to exclude the rest which not being false could not offend   me I will not therefore O my God be so rash a not to believe that   Thou vouchsafedst a much to that great man He without doubt when he   wrote those word perceived and thought on what truth soever we have   been able to find yea and whatsoever we have not been able nor yet   are but which may be found in them     Lastly O Lord who art God and not flesh and blood if man did see   le could any thing be concealed from Thy good Spirit who shall lead   me into the land of uprightness which Thou Thyself by those word wert   about to reveal to reader in time to come though he through whom   they were spoken perhaps among many true meaning thought on some one   which if so it be let that which he thought on be of all the highest   But to u O Lord do Thou either reveal that same or any other true   one which Thou pleasest that so whether Thou discoverest the same to   u a to that Thy servant or some other by occasion of those word   yet Thou mayest feed u not error deceive u Behold O Lord my God   how much we have written upon a few word how much I beseech Thee What   strength of ours yea what age would suffice for all Thy book in this   manner Permit me then in these more briefly to confess unto Thee and   to choose some one true certain and good sense that Thou shalt inspire   me although many should occur where many may occur this being the law   my confession that if I should say that which Thy minister intended   that is right and best for this should I endeavour which if I should   not attain yet I should say that which Thy Truth willed by his word   to tell me which revealed also unto him what It willed           BOOK XIII       I call upon Thee O my God my mercy Who createdst me and forgottest   not me forgetting Thee I call Thee into my soul which by the longing   Thyself inspirest into her Thou preparest for Thee Forsake me not now   calling upon Thee whom Thou preventedst before I called and urgedst me   with much variety of repeated call that I would hear Thee from afar   and be converted and call upon Thee that calledst after me for Thou   Lord blottedst out all my evil deservings so a not to repay into my   hand wherewith I fell from Thee and Thou hast prevented all my well   deservings so a to repay the work of Thy hand wherewith Thou madest   me because before I wa Thou wert nor wa I any thing to which   Thou mightest grant to be and yet behold I am out of Thy goodness   preventing all this which Thou hast made me and whereof Thou hast made   me For neither hadst Thou need of me nor am I any such good a to be   helpful unto Thee my Lord and God not in serving Thee a though Thou   wouldest tire in working or lest Thy power might be le if lacking   my service nor cultivating Thy service a a land that must remain   uncultivated unless I cultivated Thee but serving and worshipping   Thee that I might receive a wellbeing from Thee from whom it come   that I have a being capable of wellbeing     For of the fulness of Thy goodness doth Thy creature subsist that so   a good which could no way profit Thee nor wa of Thee lest so it   should be equal to Thee might yet be since it could be made of Thee   For what did heaven and earth which Thou madest in the Beginning   deserve of Thee Let those spiritual and corporeal nature which Thou   madest in Thy Wisdom say wherein they deserved of Thee to depend   thereon even in that their several inchoate and formless state whether   spiritual or corporeal ready to fall away into an immoderate liberty   and fardistant unlikeliness unto Theethe spiritual though without   form superior to the corporeal though formed and the corporeal though   without form better than were it altogether nothing and so to depend   upon Thy Word a formless unless by the same Word they were brought   back to Thy Unity indued with form and from Thee the One Sovereign   Good were made all very good How did they deserve of Thee to be even   without form since they had not been even this but from Thee     How did corporeal matter deserve of Thee to be even invisible and   without form seeing it were not even this but that Thou madest it and   therefore because it wa not could not deserve of Thee to be made Or   how could the inchoate spiritual creature deserve of Thee even to ebb   and flow darksomely like the deepunlike Thee unless it had been   by the same Word turned to that by Whom it wa created and by Him so   enlightened become light though not equally yet conformably to that   Form which is equal unto Thee For a in a body to be is not one with   being beautiful else could it not be deformed so likewise to a created   spirit to live is not one with living wisely else should it be wise   unchangeably But good it is for it always to hold fast to Thee lest   what light it hath obtained by turning to Thee it lose by turning   from Thee and relapse into life resembling the darksome deep For we   ourselves also who a to the soul are a spiritual creature turned away   from Thee our light were in that life sometimes darkness and still   labour amidst the relic of our darkness until in Thy Only One we   become Thy righteousness like the mountain of God For we have been   Thy judgment which are like the great deep     That which Thou saidst in the beginning of the creation Let there be   light and there wa light I do not unsuitably understand of the   spiritual creature because there wa already a sort of life which Thou   mightest illuminate But a it had no claim on Thee for a life which   could be enlightened so neither now that it wa had it any to be   enlightened For neither could it formless estate be pleasing unto   Thee unless it became light and that not by existing simply but by   beholding the illuminating light and cleaving to it so that that it   lived and lived happily it owes to nothing but Thy grace being turned   by a better change unto That which can not be changed into worse or   better which Thou alone art because Thou alone simply art unto   Thee it being not one thing to live another to live blessedly seeing   Thyself art Thine own Blessedness     What then could be wanting unto Thy good which Thou Thyself art   although these thing had either never been or remained without form   which thou madest not out of any want but out of the fulness of Thy   goodness restraining them and converting them to form not a though   Thy joy were fulfilled by them For to Thee being perfect is their   imperfection displeasing and hence were they perfected by Thee and   please Thee not a wert Thou imperfect and by their perfecting wert   also to be perfected For Thy good Spirit indeed wa borne over the   water not borne up by them a if He rested upon them For those on   whom Thy good Spirit is said to rest He cause to rest in Himself But   Thy incorruptible and unchangeable will in itself allsufficient for   itself wa borne upon that life which Thou hadst created to which   living is not one with happy living seeing it liveth also ebbing and   flowing in it own darkness for which it remaineth to be converted unto   Him by Whom it wa made and to live more and more by the fountain   of life and in His light to see light and to be perfected and   enlightened and beautified     Lo now the Trinity appears unto me in a glass darkly which is Thou my   God because Thou O Father in Him Who is the Beginning of our wisdom   Which is Thy Wisdom born of Thyself equal unto Thee and coeternal   that is in Thy Son createdst heaven and earth Much now have we said   of the Heaven of heaven and of the earth invisible and without form   and of the darksome deep in reference to the wandering instability of   it spiritual deformity unless it had been converted unto Him from   Whom it had it then degree of life and by His enlightening became a   beauteous life and the heaven of that heaven which wa afterwards   set between water and water And under the name of God I now held the   Father who made these thing and under the name of Beginning the Son   in whom He made these thing and believing a I did my God a the   Trinity I searched further in His holy word and lo Thy Spirit moved   upon the water Behold the Trinity my God Father and Son and Holy   Ghost Creator of all creation     But what wa the cause O truespeaking Lightunto Thee lift I up my   heart let it not teach me vanity dispel it darkness and tell me I   beseech Thee by our mother charity tell me the reason I beseech Thee   why after the mention of heaven and of the earth invisible and without   form and darkness upon the deep Thy Scripture should then at length   mention Thy Spirit Was it because it wa meet that the knowledge of Him   should be conveyed a being borne above and this could not be   said unless that were first mentioned over which Thy Spirit may   be understood to have been borne For neither wa He borne above the   Father nor the Son nor could He rightly be said to be borne above if   He were borne over nothing First then wa that to be spoken of over   which He might be borne and then He whom it wa meet not otherwise to   be spoken of than a being borne But wherefore wa it not meet that   the knowledge of Him should be conveyed otherwise than a being borne   above     Hence let him that is able follow with his understanding Thy Apostle   where he thus speaks Because Thy love is shed abroad in our heart by   the Holy Ghost which is given unto u and where concerning spiritual   gift he teacheth and showeth unto u a more excellent way of charity   and where he bow his knee unto Thee for u that we may know the   supereminent knowledge of the love of Christ And therefore from the   beginning wa He borne supereminent above the water To whom shall I   speak this how speak of the weight of evil desire downwards to the   steep abyss and how charity raise up again by Thy Spirit which wa   borne above the water to whom shall I speak it how speak it For it   is not in space that we are merged and emerge What can be more and yet   what le like They be affection they be love the uncleanness   of our spirit flowing away downwards with the love of care and the   holiness of Thine raising u upward by love of unanxious repose that   we may lift our heart unto Thee where Thy Spirit is borne above the   water and come to that supereminent repose when our soul shall have   passed through the water which yield no support     Angels fell away man soul fell away and thereby pointed the abyss in   that dark depth ready for the whole spiritual creation hadst not Thou   said from the beginning Let there be light and there had been light   and every obedient intelligence of Thy heavenly City had cleaved to   Thee and rested in Thy Spirit Which is borne unchangeably over every   thing changeable Otherwise had even the heaven of heaven been in   itself a darksome deep but now it is light in the Lord For even in   that miserable restlessness of the spirit who fell away and discovered   their own darkness when bared of the clothing of Thy light dost Thou   sufficiently reveal how noble Thou madest the reasonable creature to   which nothing will suffice to yield a happy rest le than Thee and so   not even herself For Thou O our God shalt lighten our darkness from   Thee riseth our garment of light and then shall our darkness be a   the noon day Give Thyself unto me O my God restore Thyself unto me   behold I love and if it be too little I would love more strongly I   can not measure so a to know how much love there yet lacketh to me ere   my life may run into Thy embracement nor turn away until it be hidden   in the hidden place of Thy Presence This only I know that woe is   me except in Thee not only without but within myself also and all   abundance which is not my God is emptiness to me     But wa not either the Father or the Son borne above the water if   this mean in space like a body then neither wa the Holy Spirit   but if the unchangeable supereminence of Divinity above all thing   changeable then were both Father and Son and Holy Ghost borne upon   the water Why then is this said of Thy Spirit only why is it said   only of Him As if He had been in place Who is not in place of Whom   only it is written that He is Thy gift In Thy Gift we rest there we   enjoy Thee Our rest is our place Love lift u up thither and Thy   good Spirit lift up our lowliness from the gate of death In Thy good   pleasure is our peace The body by it own weight strives towards it   own place Weight make not downward only but to his own place Fire   tends upward a stone downward They are urged by their own weight   they seek their own place Oil poured below water is raised above the   water water poured upon oil sink below the oil They are urged by   their own weight to seek their own place When out of their order   they are restless restored to order they are at rest My weight is my   love thereby am I borne whithersoever I am borne We are inflamed by   Thy Gift we are kindled and are carried upwards we glow inwardly and   go forward We ascend Thy way that be in our heart and sing a song of   degree we glow inwardly with Thy fire with Thy good fire and we go   because we go upwards to the peace of Jerusalem for gladdened wa I in   those who said unto me We will go up to the house of the Lord There   hath Thy good pleasure placed u that we may desire nothing else but   to abide there for ever     Blessed creature which being itself other than Thou ha known no   other condition than that so soon a it wa made it wa without   any interval by Thy Gift Which is borne above every thing changeable   borne aloft by that calling whereby Thou saidst Let there be light and   there wa light Whereas in u this took place at different time in   that we were darkness and are made light but of that is only said   what it would have been had it not been enlightened And this is so   spoken a if it had been unsettled and darksome before that so the   cause whereby it wa made otherwise might appear namely that being   turned to the Light unfailing it became light Whoso can let him   understand this let him ask of Thee Why should he trouble me a if I   could enlighten any man that cometh into this world     Which of u comprehendeth the Almighty Trinity and yet which speaks not   of It if indeed it be It Rare is the soul which while it speaks of   It know what it speaks of And they contend and strive yet without   peace no man see that vision I would that men would consider these   three that are in themselves These three be indeed far other than the   Trinity I do but tell where they may practise themselves and there   prove and feel how far they be Now the three I spake of are To Be   to Know and to Will For I Am and Know and Will I Am Knowing and   Willing and I Know myself to Be and to Will and I Will to Be and to   Know In these three then let him discern that can how inseparable   a life there is yea one life mind and one essence yea lastly how   inseparable a distinction there is and yet a distinction Surely a man   hath it before him let him look into himself and see and tell me But   when he discovers and can say any thing of these let him not therefore   think that he ha found that which is above these Unchangeable which   Is unchangeably and Knows unchangeably and Wills unchangeably and   whether because of these three there is in God also a Trinity or   whether all three be in Each so that the three belong to Each or   whether both way at once wondrously simply and yet manifoldly Itself   a bound unto Itself within Itself yet unbounded whereby It is and is   Known unto Itself and sufficeth to itself unchangeably the Selfsame   by the abundant greatness of it Unitywho can readily conceive this   who could any way express it who would any way pronounce thereon   rashly     Proceed in thy confession say to the Lord thy God O my faith Holy   Holy Holy O Lord my God in Thy Name have we been baptised Father   Son and Holy Ghost in Thy Name do we baptise Father Son and Holy   Ghost because among u also in His Christ did God make heaven and   earth namely the spiritual and carnal people of His Church Yea and   our earth before it received the form of doctrine wa invisible and   without form and we were covered with the darkness of ignorance For   Thou chastenedst man for iniquity and Thy judgment were like the great   deep unto him But because Thy Spirit wa borne above the water Thy   mercy forsook not our misery and Thou saidst Let there be light   Repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand Repent ye let there be   light And because our soul wa troubled within u we remembered Thee   O Lord from the land of Jordan and that mountain equal unto Thyself   but little for our sake and our darkness displeased u we turned unto   Thee and there wa light And behold we were sometimes darkness but   now light in the Lord     But a yet by faith and not by sight for by hope we are saved but hope   that is seen is not hope As yet doth deep call unto deep but now in   the voice of Thy waterspout As yet doth he that saith I could not   speak unto you a unto spiritual but a unto carnal even he a yet   doth not think himself to have apprehended and forgetteth those thing   which are behind and reacheth forth to those which are before and   groaneth being burthened and his soul thirsteth after the Living   God a the hart after the waterbrooks and saith When shall I come   desiring to be clothed upon with his house which is from heaven and   calleth upon this lower deep saying Be not conformed to this world   but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind And be not child   in understanding but in malice be ye child that in understanding   ye may be perfect and O foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you But   now no longer in his own voice but in Thine who sentest Thy Spirit from   above through Him who ascended up on high and set open the floodgate   of His gift that the force of His stream might make glad the city of   God Him doth this friend of the Bridegroom sigh after having now the   firstfruits of the Spirit laid up with Him yet still groaning within   himself waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of his body   to Him he sigh a member of the Bride for Him he is jealous a being   a friend of the Bridegroom for Him he is jealous not for himself   because in the voice of Thy waterspout not in his own voice doth he   call to that other depth over whom being jealous he feareth lest a   the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty so their mind should be   corrupted from the purity that is in our Bridegroom Thy only Son O   what a light of beauty will that be when we shall see Him a He is   and those tear be passed away which have been my meat day and night   whilst they daily say unto me Where is now Thy God     Behold I too say O my God Where art Thou see where Thou art in   Thee I breathe a little when I pour out my soul by myself in the voice   of joy and praise the sound of him that keep holyday And yet again   it is sad because it relapseth and becomes a deep or rather perceives   itself still to be a deep Unto it speaks my faith which Thou hast   kindled to enlighten my foot in the night Why art thou sad O my soul   and why dost thou trouble me Hope in the Lord His word is a lanthorn   unto thy foot hope and endure until the night the mother of the   wicked until the wrath of the Lord be overpast whereof we also were   once child who were sometimes darkness relic whereof we bear   about u in our body dead because of sin until the day break and the   shadow fly away Hope thou in the Lord in the morning I shall stand in   Thy presence and contemplate Thee I shall for ever confess unto Thee   In the morning I shall stand in Thy presence and shall see the health   of my countenance my God who also shall quicken our mortal body by   the Spirit that dwelleth in u because He hath in mercy been borne   over our inner darksome and floating deep from Whom we have in this   pilgrimage received an earnest that we should now be light whilst we   are saved by hope and are the child of light and the child of   the day not the child of the night nor of the darkness which yet   sometimes we were Betwixt whom and u in this uncertainty of human   knowledge Thou only dividest Thou who provest our heart and callest   the light day and the darkness night For who discerneth u but   Thou And what have we that we have not received of Thee out of the   same lump vessel are made unto honour whereof others also are made   unto dishonour     Or who except Thou our God made for u that firmament of authority   over u in Thy Divine Scripture a it is said For heaven shall be   folded up like a scroll and now is it stretched over u like a skin   For Thy Divine Scripture is of more eminent authority since those   mortal by whom Thou dispensest it unto u underwent mortality And   Thou knowest Lord Thou knowest how Thou with skin didst clothe men   when they by sin became mortal Whence Thou hast like a skin stretched   out the firmament of Thy book that is Thy harmonizing word which   by the ministry of mortal men Thou spreadest over u For by their very   death wa that solid firmament of authority in Thy discourse set forth   by them more eminently extended over all that be under it which whilst   they lived here wa not so eminently extended Thou hadst not a yet   spread abroad the heaven like a skin Thou hadst not a yet enlarged in   all direction the glory of their death     Let u look O Lord upon the heaven the work of Thy finger clear   from our eye that cloud which Thou hast spread under them There is   Thy testimony which giveth wisdom unto the little one perfect O my   God Thy praise out of the mouth of babe and suckling For we know no   other book which so destroy pride which so destroy the enemy and the   defender who resisteth Thy reconciliation by defending his own sin I   know not Lord I know not any other such pure word which so persuade   me to confess and make my neck pliant to Thy yoke and invite me to   serve Thee for nought Let me understand them good Father grant this   to me who am placed under them because for those placed under them   hast Thou established them     Other water there be above this firmament I believe immortal and   separated from earthly corruption Let them praise Thy Name let them   praise Thee the supercelestial people Thine angel who have no need   to gaze up at this firmament or by reading to know of Thy Word For   they always behold Thy face and there read without any syllable in   time what willeth Thy eternal will they read they choose they love   They are ever reading and that never pass away which they read for   by choosing and by loving they read the very unchangeableness of Thy   counsel Their book is never closed nor their scroll folded up seeing   Thou Thyself art this to them and art eternally because Thou hast   ordained them above this firmament which Thou hast firmly settled over   the infirmity of the lower people where they might gaze up and learn   Thy mercy announcing in time Thee Who madest time For Thy mercy O   Lord is in the heaven and Thy truth reacheth unto the cloud The   cloud pas away but the heaven abideth The preacher of Thy word pas   out of this life into another but Thy Scripture is spread abroad over   the people even unto the end of the world Yet heaven and earth also   shall pas away but Thy word shall not pas away Because the scroll   shall be rolled together and the grass over which it wa spread shall   with the goodliness of it pas away but Thy Word remaineth for ever   which now appeareth unto u under the dark image of the cloud and   through the glass of the heaven not a it is because we also though   the wellbeloved of Thy Son yet it hath not yet appeared what we   shall be He looketh through the lattice of our flesh and He spake u   tenderly and kindled u and we ran after His odour But when He shall   appear then shall we be like Him for we shall see Him a He is As He   is Lord will our sight be     For altogether a Thou art Thou only knowest Who art unchangeably   and knowest unchangeably and willest unchangeably And Thy Essence   Knoweth and Willeth unchangeably and Thy Knowledge Is and Willeth   unchangeably and Thy Will Is and Knoweth unchangeably Nor seemeth it   right in Thine eye that a the Unchangeable Light knoweth Itself so   should it be known by the thing enlightened and changeable Therefore   is my soul like a land where no water is because a it can not of itself   enlighten itself so can it not of itself satisfy itself For so is the   fountain of life with Thee like a in Thy light we shall see light     Who gathered the embittered together into one society For they have all   one end a temporal and earthly felicity for attaining whereof they do   all thing though they waver up and down with an innumerable variety of   care Who Lord but Thou saidst Let the water be gathered together   into one place and let the dry land appear which thirsteth after Thee   For the sea also is Thine and Thou hast made it and Thy hand prepared   the dry land Nor is the bitterness of men will but the gathering   together of the water called sea for Thou restrainest the wicked   desire of men soul and settest them their bound how far they may   be allowed to pas that their wave may break one against another and   thus makest Thou it a sea by the order of Thy dominion over all thing     But the soul that thirst after Thee and that appear before Thee being   by other bound divided from the society of the sea Thou waterest by   a sweet spring that the earth may bring forth her fruit and Thou Lord   God so commanding our soul may bud forth work of mercy according   to their kind loving our neighbour in the relief of his bodily   necessity having seed in itself according to it likeness when from   feeling of our infirmity we compassionate so a to relieve the needy   helping them a we would be helped if we were in like need not only   in thing easy a in herb yielding seed but also in the protection of   our assistance with our best strength like the tree yielding fruit   that is welldoing in rescuing him that suffers wrong from the hand   of the powerful and giving him the shelter of protection by the mighty   strength of just judgment     So Lord so I beseech Thee let there spring up a Thou doest a   Thou givest cheerfulness and ability let truth spring out of the earth   and righteousness look down from heaven and let there be light in the   firmament Let u break our bread to the hungry and bring the houseless   poor to our house Let u clothe the naked and despise not those of our   own flesh Which fruit having sprung out of the earth see it is good   and let our temporary light break forth and ourselves from this lower   fruitfulness of action arriving at the delightfulness of contemplation   obtaining the Word of Life above appear like light in the world   cleaving to the firmament of Thy Scripture For there Thou instructest   u to divide between the thing intellectual and thing of sense a   betwixt the day and the night or between soul given either to thing   intellectual or thing of sense so that now not Thou only in the   secret of Thy judgment a before the firmament wa made dividest   between the light and the darkness but Thy spiritual child also   set and ranked in the same firmament now that Thy grace is laid open   throughout the world may give light upon the earth and divide betwixt   the day and the night and be for sign of time that old thing   are passed away and behold all thing are become new and that our   salvation is nearer than when we believed and that the night is far   spent and the day is at hand and that Thou wilt crown Thy year with   blessing sending the labourer of Thy goodness into Thy harvest in   sowing whereof others have laboured sending also into another field   whose harvest shall be in the end Thus grantest Thou the prayer of him   that asketh and blessest the year of the just but Thou art the same   and in Thy year which fail not Thou preparest a garner for our passing   year For Thou by an eternal counsel dost in their proper season   bestow heavenly blessing upon the earth For to one is given by the   Spirit the word of wisdom a it were the lesser light to another   faith to another the gift with the light of perspicuous truth a it   were for the rule of the day To another the word of knowledge by the   same Spirit a it were the lesser light to another faith to another   the gift of healing to another the working of miracle to another   prophecy to another discerning of spirit to another diver kind of   tongue And all these a it were star For all these worketh the one   and selfsame spirit dividing to every man his own a He will and   causing star to appear manifestly to profit withal But the word of   knowledge wherein are contained all Sacraments which are varied in   their season a it were the moon and those other notice of gift   which are reckoned up in order a it were star inasmuch a they come   short of that brightness of wisdom which gladdens the forementioned   day are only for the rule of the night For they are necessary to such   a that Thy most prudent servant could not speak unto a unto spiritual   but a unto carnal even he who speaketh wisdom among those that are   perfect But the natural man a it were a babe in Christ and fed on   milk until he be strengthened for solid meat and his eye be enabled to   behold the Sun let him not dwell in a night forsaken of all light but   be content with the light of the moon and the star So dost Thou speak   to u our Allwise God in Thy Book Thy firmament that we may discern   all thing in an admirable contemplation though a yet in sign and in   time and in day and in year     But first wash you be clean put away evil from your soul and from   before mine eye that the dry land may appear Learn to do good judge   the fatherless plead for the widow that the earth may bring forth the   green herb for meat and the tree bearing fruit and come let u reason   together saith the Lord that there may be light in the firmament of   the heaven and they may shine upon the earth That rich man asked of   the good Master what he should do to attain eternal life Let the   good Master tell him whom he thought no more than man but He is good   because He is God let Him tell him if he would enter into life he   must keep the commandment let him put away from him the bitterness   of malice and wickedness not kill not commit adultery not steal not   bear false witness that the dry land may appear and bring forth the   honouring of father and mother and the love of our neighbour All these   saith he have I kept Whence then so many thorn if the earth be   fruitful Go root up the spreading thicket of covetousness sell that   thou hast and be filled with fruit by giving to the poor and thou   shalt have treasure in heaven and follow the Lord if thou wilt be   perfect associated with them among whom He speaketh wisdom Who   knoweth what to distribute to the day and to the night that thou also   mayest know it and for thee there may be light in the firmament of   heaven which will not be unless thy heart be there nor will that   either be unless there thy treasure be a thou hast heard of the good   Master But that barren earth wa grieved and the thorn choked the   word     But you chosen generation you weak thing of the world who have   forsaken all that ye may follow the Lord go after Him and confound   the mighty go after Him ye beautiful foot and shine ye in the   firmament that the heaven may declare His glory dividing between the   light of the perfect though not a the angel and the darkness of the   little one though not despised Shine over the earth and let the   day lightened by the sun utter unto day speech of wisdom and night   shining with the moon show unto night the word of knowledge The moon   and star shine for the night yet doth not the night obscure them   seeing they give it light in it degree For behold God saying a   it were Let there be light in the firmament of heaven there came   suddenly a sound from heaven a it had been the rushing of a mighty   wind and there appeared cloven tongue like a of fire and it sat upon   each of them And there were made light in the firmament of heaven   having the word of life Run ye to and fro every where ye holy fire   ye beauteous fire for ye are the light of the world nor are ye put   under a bushel He whom you cleave unto is exalted and hath exalted   you Run ye to and fro and be known unto all nation     Let the sea also conceive and bring forth your work and let the water   bring forth the moving creature that hath life For ye separating the   precious from the vile are made the mouth of God by whom He saith Let   the water bring forth not the living creature which the earth brings   forth but the moving creature having life and the fowl that fly above   the earth For Thy Sacraments O God by the ministry of Thy holy one   have moved amid the wave of temptation of the world to hallow the   Gentiles in Thy Name in Thy Baptism And amid these thing many great   wonder were wrought a it were great whale and the voice of Thy   messenger flying above the earth in the open firmament of Thy Book   that being set over them a their authority under which they were to   fly whithersoever they went For there is no speech nor language where   their voice is not heard seeing their sound is gone through all the   earth and their word to the end of the world because Thou Lord   multipliedst them by blessing     Speak I untruly or do I mingle and confound and not distinguish   between the lucid knowledge of these thing in the firmament of heaven   and the material work in the wavy sea and under the firmament of   heaven For of those thing whereof the knowledge is substantial and   defined without any increase by generation a it were light of wisdom   and knowledge yet even of them the material operation are many and   diver and one thing growing out of another they are multiplied by Thy   blessing O God who hast refreshed the fastidiousness of mortal sens   that so one thing in the understanding of our mind may by the motion   of the body be many way set out and expressed These Sacraments have   the water brought forth but in Thy word The necessity of the people   estranged from the eternity of Thy truth have brought them forth   but in Thy Gospel because the water themselves cast them forth the   diseased bitterness whereof wa the cause why they were sent forth in   Thy Word     Now are all thing fair that Thou hast made but behold Thyself art   unutterably fairer that madest all from whom had not Adam fallen the   brackishness of the sea had never flowed out of him that is the human   race so profoundly curious and tempestuously swelling and restlessly   tumbling up and down and then had there been no need of Thy dispenser   to work in many water after a corporeal and sensible manner   mysterious doings and saying For such those moving and flying   creature now seem to me to mean whereby people being initiated and   consecrated by corporeal Sacraments should not further profit unless   their soul had a spiritual life and unless after the word of admission   it looked forward to perfection     And hereby in Thy Word not the deepness of the sea but the earth   separated from the bitterness of the water brings forth not the   moving creature that hath life but the living soul For now hath it no   more need of baptism a the heathen have and a itself had when it   wa covered with the water for no other entrance is there into the   kingdom of heaven since Thou hast appointed that this should be the   entrance nor doe it seek after wonderfulness of miracle to work   belief for it is not such that unless it see sign and wonder it   will not believe now that the faithful earth is separated from the   water that were bitter with infidelity and tongue are for a sign not   to them that believe but to them that believe not Neither then doe   that earth which Thou hast founded upon the water need that flying   kind which at Thy word the water brought forth Send Thou Thy word   into it by Thy messenger for we speak of their working yet it is Thou   that workest in them that they may work out a living soul in it The   earth brings it forth because the earth is the cause that they work   this in the soul a the sea wa the cause that they wrought upon   the moving creature that have life and the fowl that fly under the   firmament of heaven of whom the earth hath no need although it feed   upon that fish which wa taken out of the deep upon that table which   Thou hast prepared in the presence of them that believe For therefore   wa He taken out of the deep that He might feed the dry land and the   fowl though bred in the sea is yet multiplied upon the earth For of   the first preaching of the Evangelists man infidelity wa the cause   yet are the faithful also exhorted and blessed by them manifoldly from   day to day But the living soul take his beginning from the earth for   it profit only those already among the Faithful to contain themselves   from the love of this world that so their soul may live unto Thee   which wa dead while it lived in pleasure in deathbringing pleasure   Lord for Thou Lord art the lifegiving delight of the pure heart     Now then let Thy minister work upon the earthnot a upon the water   of infidelity by preaching and speaking by miracle and Sacraments   and mystic word wherein ignorance the mother of admiration might   be intent upon them out of a reverence towards those secret sign For   such is the entrance unto the Faith for the son of Adam forgetful of   Thee while they hide themselves from Thy face and become a darksome   deep Butlet Thy minister work now a on the dry land separated from   the whirlpool of the great deep and let them be a pattern unto the   Faithful by living before them and stirring them up to imitation For   thus do men hear so a not to hear only but to do also Seek the Lord   and your soul shall live that the earth may bring forth the living   soul Be not conformed to the world Contain yourselves from it the   soul life by avoiding what it dy by affecting Contain yourselves   from the ungoverned wildness of pride the sluggish voluptuousness of   luxury and the false name of knowledge that so the wild beast may be   tamed the cattle broken to the yoke the serpent harmless For   these be the motion of our mind under an allegory that is to say the   haughtiness of pride the delight of lust and the poison of curiosity   are the motion of a dead soul for the soul dy not so a to lose all   motion because it dy by forsaking the fountain of life and so is   taken up by this transitory world and is conformed unto it     But Thy word O God is the fountain of life eternal and passeth not   away wherefore this departure of the soul is restrained by Thy word   when it is said unto u Be not conformed unto this world that so the   earth may in the fountain of life bring forth a living soul that is   a soul made continent in Thy Word by Thy Evangelists by following the   follower of Thy Christ For this is after his kind because a man is   wo nt to imitate his friend Be ye saith he a I am for I also am   a you are Thus in this living soul shall there be good beast in   meekness of action for Thou hast commanded Go on with thy business in   meekness so shalt thou be beloved by all men and good cattle which   neither if they eat shall they overabound nor if they eat not have   any lack and good serpent not dangerous to do hurt but wise to take   heed and only making so much search into this temporal nature a may   suffice that eternity be clearly seen being understood by the thing   that are made For these creature are obedient unto reason when being   restrained from deadly prevailing upon u they live and are good     For behold O Lord our God our Creator when our affection have   been restrained from the love of the world by which we died through   evilliving and begun to be a living soul through good living and   Thy word which Thou spokest by Thy apostle is made good in u Be not   conformed to this world there follows that also which Thou presently   subjoinedst saying But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind   not now after your kind a though following your neighbour who went   before you nor a living after the example of some better man for Thou   saidst not Let man be made after his kind but Let u make man after   our own image and similitude that we might prove what Thy will is For   to this purpose said that dispenser of Thine who begat child by the   Gospel that he might not for ever have them babe whom he must be   fain to feed with milk and cherish a a nurse be ye transformed saith   he by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good   and acceptable and perfect will of God Wherefore Thou sayest not Let   man be made but Let u make man Nor saidst Thou according to his   kind but after our image and likeness For man being renewed in his   mind and beholding and understanding Thy truth need not man a his   director so a to follow after his kind but by Thy direction proveth   what is that good that acceptable and perfect will of Thine yea Thou   teachest him now made capable to discern the Trinity of the Unity and   the Unity of the Trinity Wherefore to that said in the plural Let u   make man is yet subjoined in the singular And God made man and   to that said in the plural After our likeness is subjoined in the   singular After the image of God Thus is man renewed in the knowledge   of God after the image of Him that created him and being made   spiritual he judgeth all thing all thing which are to be judged   yet himself is judged of no man     But that he judgeth all thing this answer to his having dominion over   the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over all cattle   and wild beast and over all the earth and over every creeping thing   that creepeth upon the earth For this he doth by the understanding of   his mind whereby he perceiveth the thing of the Spirit of God whereas   otherwise man being placed in honour had no understanding and is   compared unto the brute beast and is become like unto them In Thy   Church therefore O our God according to Thy grace which Thou hast   bestowed upon it for we are Thy workmanship created unto good   work not those only who are spiritually set over but they also who   spiritually are subject to those that are set over themfor in this   way didst Thou make man male and female in Thy grace spiritual where   according to the sex of body there is neither male nor female because   neither Jew nor Grecian neither bond nor freeSpiritual person   whether such a are set over or such a obey do judge spiritually   not of that spiritual knowledge which shine in the firmament for they   ought not to judge a to so supreme authority nor may they judge of   Thy Book itself even though something there shineth not clearly for we   submit our understanding unto it and hold for certain that even what   is closed to our sight is yet rightly and truly spoken For so man   though now spiritual and renewed in the knowledge of God after His image   that created him ought to be a doer of the law not a judge Neither   doth he judge of that distinction of spiritual and carnal men who   are known unto Thine eye O our God and have not a yet discovered   themselves unto u by work that by their fruit we might know them   but Thou Lord dost even now know them and hast divided and called   them in secret or ever the firmament wa made Nor doth he though   spiritual judge the unquiet people of this world for what hath he   to do to judge them that are without knowing not which of them shall   hereafter come into the sweetness of Thy grace and which continue in   the perpetual bitterness of ungodliness     Man therefore whom Thou hast made after Thine own image received not   dominion over the light of heaven nor over that hidden heaven   itself nor over the day and the night which Thou calledst before the   foundation of the heaven nor over the gathering together of the water   which is the sea but He received dominion over the fish of the sea   and the fowl of the air and over all cattle and over all the earth   and over all creeping thing which creep upon the earth For He judgeth   and approveth what He findeth right and He disalloweth what He findeth   amiss whether in the celebration of those Sacraments by which such   are initiated a Thy mercy search out in many water or in that in   which that Fish is set forth which taken out of the deep the devout   earth feedeth upon or in the expression and sign of word subject to   the authority of Thy Booksuch sign a proceed out of the mouth   and sound forth flying a it were under the firmament by interpreting   expounding discoursing disputing consecrating or praying unto Thee   so that the people may answer Amen The vocal pronouncing of all which   word is occasioned by the deep of this world and the blindness of the   flesh which can not see thought So that there is need to speak aloud   into the ear so that although flying fowl be multiplied upon the   earth yet they derive their beginning from the water The spiritual   man judgeth also by allowing of what is right and disallowing what he   find amiss in the work and life of the faithful their alms a it   were the earth bringing forth fruit and of the living soul living   by the taming of the affection in chastity in fasting in holy   meditation and of those thing which are perceived by the sens of   the body Upon all these is he now said to judge wherein he hath also   power of correction     But what is this and what kind of mystery Behold Thou blessest   mankind O Lord that they may increase and multiply and replenish the   earth dost Thou not thereby give u a hint to understand something why   didst Thou not a well bless the light which Thou calledst day nor the   firmament of heaven nor the light nor the star nor the earth nor   the sea I might say that Thou O God who created created u after   Thine Image I might say that it had been Thy good pleasure to bestow   this blessing peculiarly upon man hadst Thou not in like manner blessed   the fish and the whale that they should increase and multiply and   replenish the water of the sea and that the fowl should be multiplied   upon the earth I might say likewise that this blessing pertained   properly unto such creature a are bred of their own kind had I found   it given to the fruittrees and plant and beast of the earth But   now neither unto the herb nor the tree nor the beast nor serpent   is it said Increase and multiply notwithstanding all these a well a   the fish fowl or men do by generation increase and continue their   kind     What then shall I say O Truth my Light that it wa idly said and   without meaning Not so O Father of piety far be it from a minister   of Thy word to say so And if I understand not what Thou meanest by   that phrase let my better that is those of more understanding than   myself make better use of it according a Thou my God hast given to   each man to understand But let my confession also be pleasing in Thine   eye wherein I confess unto Thee that I believe O Lord that Thou   spokest not so in vain nor will I suppress what this lesson suggests   to me For it is true nor do I see what should hinder me from thus   understanding the figurative saying of Thy Bible For I know a thing   to be manifoldly signified by corporeal expression which is understood   one way by the mind and that understood many way in the mind which   is signified one way by corporeal expression Behold the single love   of God and our neighbour by what manifold sacrament and innumerable   language and in each several language in how innumerable mode of   speaking it is corporeally expressed Thus do the offspring of the   water increase and multiply Observe again whosoever readest this   behold what Scripture delivers and the voice pronounces one only way   In the Beginning God created heaven and earth is it not understood   manifoldly not through any deceit of error but by various kind of   true sens Thus do man offspring increase and multiply     If therefore we conceive of the nature of the thing themselves not   allegorically but properly then doe the phrase increase and multiply   agree unto all thing that come of seed But if we treat of the word   a figuratively spoken which I rather suppose to be the purpose of   the Scripture which doth not surely superfluously ascribe this   benediction to the offspring of aquatic animal and man only then   do we find multitude to belong to creature spiritual a well a   corporeal a in heaven and earth and to righteous and unrighteous a   in light and darkness and to holy author who have been the minister   of the Law unto u a in the firmament which is settled betwixt   the water and the water and to the society of people yet in the   bitterness of infidelity a in the sea and to the zeal of holy soul   a in the dry land and to work of mercy belonging to this present   life a in the herb bearing seed and in tree bearing fruit and to   spiritual gift set forth for edification a in the light of heaven   and to affection formed unto temperance a in the living soul In all   these instance we meet with multitude abundance and increase but   what shall in such wise increase and multiply that one thing may be   expressed many way and one expression understood many way we find   not except in sign corporeally expressed and in thing mentally   conceived By sign corporeally pronounced we understand the generation   of the water necessarily occasioned by the depth of the flesh   by thing mentally conceived human generation on account of the   fruitfulness of reason And for this end do we believe Thee Lord to   have said to these kind Increase and multiply For in this blessing I   conceive Thee to have granted u a power and a faculty both to express   several way what we understand but one and to understand several way   what we read to be obscurely delivered but in one Thus are the   water of the sea replenished which are not moved but by several   signification thus with human increase is the earth also replenished   whose dryness appeareth in it longing and reason ruleth over it     I would also say O Lord my God what the following Scripture mind me   of yea I will say and not fear For I will say the truth Thyself   inspiring me with what Thou willedst me to deliver out of those word   But by no other inspiration than Thine do I believe myself to speak   truth seeing Thou art the Truth and every man a liar He therefore   that speaketh a lie speaketh of his own that therefore I may speak   truth I will speak of Thine Behold Thou hast given unto u for food   every herb bearing seed which is upon all the earth and every tree   in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed And not to u alone but   also to all the fowl of the air and to the beast of the earth and to   all creeping thing but unto the fish and to the great whale hast   Thou not given them Now we said that by these fruit of the earth were   signified and figured in an allegory the work of mercy which are   provided for the necessity of this life out of the fruitful earth   Such an earth wa the devout Onesiphorus unto whose house Thou gavest   mercy because he often refreshed Thy Paul and wa not ashamed of his   chain Thus did also the brother and such fruit did they bear who out   of Macedonia supplied what wa lacking to him But how grieved he for   some tree which did not afford him the fruit due unto him where he   saith At my first answer no man stood by me but all men forsook me I   pray God that it may not be laid to their charge For these fruit are   due to such a minister the spiritual doctrine unto u out of their   understanding of the divine mystery and they are due to them a men   yea and due to them also a the living soul which giveth itself a an   example in all continency and due unto them also a flying creature   for their blessing which are multiplied upon the earth because their   sound went out into all land     But they are fed by these fruit that are delighted with them nor are   they delighted with them whose God is their belly For neither in them   that yield them are the thing yielded the fruit but with what mind   they yield them He therefore that served God and not his own belly   I plainly see why he rejoiced I see it and I rejoice with him For he   had received from the Philippians what they had sent by Epaphroditus   unto him and yet I perceive why he rejoiced For whereat he rejoiced   upon that he fed for speaking in truth I rejoiced saith he greatly   in the Lord that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again   wherein ye were also careful but it had become wearisome unto you   These Philippians then had now dried up with a long weariness and   withered a it were a to bearing this fruit of a good work and he   rejoiceth for them that they flourished again not for himself that   they supplied his want Therefore subjoins he not that I speak in   respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith   to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound   every where and in all thing I am instructed both to be full and to be   hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all thing through   Him which strengtheneth me     Whereat then rejoicest thou O great Paul whereat rejoicest thou   whereon feedest thou O man renewed in the knowledge of God after the   image of Him that created thee thou living soul of so much continency   thou tongue like flying fowl speaking mystery for to such   creature is this food due what is it that feed thee joy Hear   we what follows notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did   communicate with my affliction Hereat he rejoiceth hereon feedeth   because they had well done not because his strait wa eased who saith   unto Thee Thou hast enlarged me when I wa in distress for that he   knew to abound and to suffer want in Thee Who strengthenest him   For ye Philippians also know saith he that in the beginning of the   Gospel when I departed from Macedonia no Church communicated with   me a concerning giving and receiving but ye only For even in   Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity Unto these good   work he now rejoiceth that they are returned and is gladdened that   they flourished again a when a fruitful field resume it green     Was it for his own necessity because he said Ye sent unto my   necessity Rejoiceth he for that Verily not for that But how know we   this Because himself say immediately not because I desire a gift but   I desire fruit I have learned of Thee my God to distinguish betwixt   a gift and fruit A gift is the thing itself which he give that   imparts these necessary unto u a money meat drink clothing   shelter help but the fruit is the good and right will of the giver   For the Good Master said not only He that receiveth a prophet but   added in the name of a prophet nor did He only say He that receiveth   a righteous man but added in the name of a righteous man So verily   shall the one receive the reward of a prophet the other the reward of   a righteous man nor saith He only He that shall give to drink a cup   of cold water to one of my little one but added in the name of a   disciple and so concludeth Verily I say unto you he shall not lose   his reward The gift is to receive a prophet to receive a righteous   man to give a cup of cold water to a disciple but the fruit to do   this in the name of a prophet in the name of a righteous man in the   name of a disciple With fruit wa Elijah fed by the widow that knew   she fed a man of God and therefore fed him but by the raven wa he fed   with a gift Nor wa the inner man of Elijah so fed but the outer only   which might also for want of that food have perished     I will then speak what is true in Thy sight O Lord that when carnal   men and infidel for the gaining and initiating whom the initiatory   Sacraments and the mighty working of miracle are necessary which we   suppose to be signified by the name of fish and whale undertake   the bodily refreshment or otherwise succour Thy servant with something   useful for this present life whereas they be ignorant why this is to   be done and to what end neither do they feed these nor are these   fed by them because neither do the one do it out of an holy and right   intent nor do the other rejoice at their gift whose fruit they a   yet behold not For upon that is the mind fed of which it is glad   And therefore do not the fish and whale feed upon such meat a the   earth brings not forth until after it wa separated and divided from the   bitterness of the wave of the sea     And Thou O God sawest every thing that Thou hadst made and behold   it wa very good Yea we also see the same and behold all thing are   very good Of the several kind of Thy work when Thou hadst said let   them be and they were Thou sawest each that it wa good Seven time   have I counted it to be written that Thou sawest that that which Thou   madest wa good and this is the eighth that Thou sawest every thing   that Thou hadst made and behold it wa not only good but also very   good a being now altogether For severally they were only good but   altogether both good and very good All beautiful body express the   same by reason that a body consisting of member all beautiful is   far more beautiful than the same member by themselves are by whose   wellordered blending the whole is perfected notwithstanding that the   member severally be also beautiful     And I looked narrowly to find whether seven or eight time Thou sawest   that Thy work were good when they pleased Thee but in Thy seeing I   found no time whereby I might understand that Thou sawest so often   what Thou madest And I said Lord is not this Thy Scripture true   since Thou art true and being Truth hast set it forth why then dost   Thou say unto me that in Thy seeing there be no time whereas this   Thy Scripture tell me that what Thou madest each day Thou sawest that   it wa good and when I counted them I found how often Unto this Thou   answerest me for Thou art my God and with a strong voice tellest Thy   servant in his inner ear breaking through my deafness and cry O   man that which My Scripture saith I say and yet doth that speak in   time but time ha no relation to My Word because My Word exists   in equal eternity with Myself So the thing which ye see through My   Spirit I see like a what ye speak by My Spirit I speak And so when   ye see those thing in time I see them not in time a when ye speak in   time I speak them not in time     And I heard O Lord my God and drank up a drop of sweetness out of Thy   truth and understood that certain men there be who mislike Thy work   and say that many of them Thou madest compelled by necessity such   a the fabric of the heaven and harmony of the star and that Thou   madest them not of what wa Thine but that they were otherwhere and   from other source created for Thee to bring together and compact and   combine when out of Thy conquered enemy Thou raisedst up the wall of   the universe that they bound down by the structure might not again   be able to rebel against Thee For other thing they say Thou neither   madest them nor even compactedst them such a all flesh and all very   minute creature and whatsoever hath it root in the earth but that   a mind at enmity with Thee and another nature not created by Thee and   contrary unto Thee did in these lower stage of the world beget and   frame these thing Frenzied are they who say thus because they see not   Thy work by Thy Spirit nor recognise Thee in them     But they who by Thy Spirit see these thing Thou seest in them   Therefore when they see that these thing are good Thou seest that they   are good and whatsoever thing for Thy sake please Thou pleasest in   them and what through Thy Spirit please u they please Thee in u For   what man knoweth the thing of a man save the spirit of a man which is   in him even so the thing of God knoweth no one but the Spirit of God   Now we saith he have received not the spirit of this world but the   Spirit which is of God that we might know the thing that are freely   given to u of God And I am admonished Truly the thing of God   knoweth no one but the Spirit of God how then do we also know what   thing are given u of God Answer is made me because the thing   which we know by His Spirit even these no one knoweth but the Spirit   of God For a it is rightly said unto those that were to speak by the   Spirit of God it is not ye that speak so is it rightly said to them   that know through the Spirit of God It is not ye that know And no   le then is it rightly said to those that see through the Spirit of   God It is not ye that see so whatsoever through the Spirit of God   they see to be good it is not they but God that see that it is good   It is one thing then for a man to think that to be ill which is good   a the forenamed do another that that which is good a man should see   that it is good a Thy creature be pleasing unto many because they   be good whom yet Thou pleasest not in them when they prefer to enjoy   them to Thee and another that when a man see a thing that it is   good God should in him see that it is good so namely that He should   be loved in that which He made Who can not be loved but by the Holy   Ghost which He hath given Because the love of God is shed abroad in our   heart by the Holy Ghost Which is given unto u by Whom we see that   whatsoever in any degree is is good For from Him it is who Himself Is   not in degree but what He Is Is     Thanks to Thee O Lord We behold the heaven and earth whether the   corporeal part superior and inferior or the spiritual and corporeal   creature and in the adorning of these part whereof the universal pile   of the world or rather the universal creation doth consist we see   light made and divided from the darkness We see the firmament of   heaven whether that primary body of the world between the spiritual   upper water and the inferior corporeal water or since this also   is called heaven this space of air through which wander the fowl of   heaven betwixt those water which are in vapour borne above them and   in clear night distill down in dew and those heavier water which flow   along the earth We behold a face of water gathered together in the   field of the sea and the dry land both void and formed so a to be   visible and harmonized yea and the matter of herb and tree We behold   the light shining from above the sun to suffice for the day the moon   and the star to cheer the night and that by all these time should   be marked and signified We behold on all side a moist element   replenished with fish beast and bird because the grossness of   the air which bear up the flight of bird thickeneth itself by the   exhalation of the water We behold the face of the earth decked out   with earthly creature and man created after Thy image and likeness   even through that Thy very image and likeness that is the power of   reason and understanding set over all irrational creature And a   in his soul there is one power which ha dominion by directing another   made subject that it might obey so wa there for the man corporeally   also made a woman who in the mind of her reasonable understanding   should have a parity of nature but in the sex of her body should be in   like manner subject to the sex of her husband a the appetite of doing   is fain to conceive the skill of rightdoing from the reason of   the mind These thing we behold and they are severally good and   altogether very good     Let Thy work praise Thee that we may love Thee and let u love Thee   that Thy work may praise Thee which from time have beginning and   ending rising and setting growth and decay form and privation They   have then their succession of morning and evening part secretly part   apparently for they were made of nothing by Thee not of Thee not of   any matter not Thine or that wa before but of matter concreated that   is at the same time created by Thee because to it state without   form Thou without any interval of time didst give form For seeing   the matter of heaven and earth is one thing and the form another Thou   madest the matter of merely nothing but the form of the world out of   the matter without form yet both together so that the form should   follow the matter without any interval of delay     We have also examined what Thou willedst to be shadowed forth whether   by the creation or the relation of thing in such an order And we have   seen that thing singly are good and together very good in Thy Word   in Thy OnlyBegotten both heaven and earth the Head and the body of   the Church in Thy predestination before all time without morning   and evening But when Thou begannest to execute in time the thing   predestinated to the end Thou mightest reveal hidden thing and   rectify our disorder for our sin hung over u and we had sunk into   the dark deep and Thy good Spirit wa borne over u to help u in due   season and Thou didst justify the ungodly and dividest them from the   wicked and Thou madest the firmament of authority of Thy Book between   those placed above who were to be docile unto Thee and those under   who were to be subject to them and Thou gatheredst together the society   of unbeliever into one conspiracy that the zeal of the faithful might   appear and they might bring forth work of mercy even distributing to   the poor their earthly rich to obtain heavenly And after this didst   Thou kindle certain light in the firmament Thy Holy one having the   word of life and shining with an eminent authority set on high through   spiritual gift after that again for the initiation of the unbelieving   Gentiles didst Thou out of corporeal matter produce the Sacraments and   visible miracle and form of word according to the firmament of Thy   Book by which the faithful should be blessed and multiplied Next   didst Thou form the living soul of the faithful through affection well   ordered by the vigour of continency and after that the mind subjected   to Thee alone and needing to imitate no human authority hast Thou   renewed after Thy image and likeness and didst subject it rational   action to the excellency of the understanding a the woman to the man   and to all Offices of Thy Ministry necessary for the perfecting of the   faithful in this life Thou willedst that for their temporal us good   thing fruitful to themselves in time to come be given by the same   faithful All these we see and they are very good because Thou seest   them in u Who hast given unto u Thy Spirit by which we might see   them and in them love Thee     O Lord God give peace unto u for Thou hast given u all thing the   peace of rest the peace of the Sabbath which hath no evening For   all this most goodly array of thing very good having finished their   course is to pas away for in them there wa morning and evening     But the seventh day hath no evening nor hath it setting because Thou   hast sanctified it to an everlasting continuance that that which Thou   didst after Thy work which were very good resting the seventh day   although Thou madest them in unbroken rest that may the voice of   Thy Book announce beforehand unto u that we also after our work   therefore very good because Thou hast given them u shall rest in   Thee also in the Sabbath of eternal life     For then shalt Thou rest in u a now Thou workest in u and so shall   that be Thy rest through u a these are Thy work through u But   Thou Lord ever workest and art ever at rest Nor dost Thou see in   time nor art moved in time nor restest in a time and yet Thou makest   thing seen in time yea the time themselves and the rest which   result from time     We therefore see these thing which Thou madest because they are but   they are because Thou seest them And we see without that they are   and within that they are good but Thou sawest them there when made   where Thou sawest them yet to be made And we were at a later time   moved to do well after our heart had conceived of Thy Spirit but in   the former time we were moved to do evil forsaking Thee but Thou the   One the Good God didst never cease doing good And we also have some   good work of Thy gift but not eternal after them we trust to rest in   Thy great hallowing But Thou being the Good which needeth no good art   ever at rest because Thy rest is Thou Thyself And what man can teach   man to understand this or what Angel an Angel or what Angel a man   Let it be asked of Thee sought in Thee knocked for at Thee so so   shall it be received so shall it be found so shall it be opened Amen                              GRATIAS TIBI DOMINE                       End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Confessions of Saint

       FROM THE HEIGHTS POEM TRANSLATED BY LA MAGNUS           PREFACE       SUPPOSING that Truth is a womanwhat then Is there not ground   for suspecting that all philosopher in so far a they have been   dogmatist have failed to understand womenthat the terrible   seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid   their address to Truth have been unskilled and unseemly method for   winning a woman Certainly she ha never allowed herself to be won and   at present every kind of dogma stand with sad and discouraged mienIF   indeed it stand at all For there are scoffer who maintain that it   ha fallen that all dogma lie on the groundnay more that it is at   it last gasp But to speak seriously there are good ground for hoping   that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive   and decided air it ha assumed may have been only a noble puerilism   and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once   and again understood WHAT ha actually sufficed for the basis of such   imposing and absolute philosophical edifice a the dogmatist have   hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time   such a the soulsuperstition which in the form of subject and   egosuperstition ha not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some   play upon word a deception on the part of grammar or an   audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very   humanalltoohuman fact The philosophy of the dogmatist it is to   be hoped wa only a promise for thousand of year afterwards a wa   astrology in still earlier time in the service of which probably more   labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any   actual science hitherto we owe to it and to it superterrestrial   pretension in Asia and Egypt the grand style of architecture It seems   that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with   everlasting claim all great thing have first to wander about the   earth a enormous and aweinspiring caricature dogmatic philosophy ha   been a caricature of this kindfor instance the Vedanta doctrine in   Asia and Platonism in Europe Let u not be ungrateful to it although   it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome   and the most dangerous of error hitherto ha been a dogmatist   errornamely Platos invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself   But now when it ha been surmounted when Europe rid of this nightmare   can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthiersleep   we WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF are the heir of all the strength   which the struggle against this error ha fostered It amounted to   the very inversion of truth and the denial of the PERSPECTIVEthe   fundamental conditionof life to speak of Spirit and the Good a Plato   spoke of them indeed one might ask a a physician How did such a   malady attack that finest product of antiquity Plato Had the wicked   Socrates really corrupted him Was Socrates after all a corrupter of   youth and deserved his hemlock But the struggle against Plato   orto speak plainer and for the peoplethe struggle against   the ecclesiastical oppression of millennium of Christianity FOR   CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE PEOPLE produced in Europe   a magnificent tension of soul such a had not existed anywhere   previously with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the   furthest goal As a matter of fact the European feel this tension a   a state of distress and twice attempt have been made in grand style to   unbend the bow once by mean of Jesuitism and the second time by mean   of democratic enlightenmentwhich with the aid of liberty of the press   and newspaperreading might in fact bring it about that the spirit   would not so easily find itself in distress The Germans invented   gunpowderall credit to them but they again made thing squarethey   invented printing But we who are neither Jesuits nor democrat   nor even sufficiently Germans we GOOD EUROPEANS and free VERY free   spiritswe have it still all the distress of spirit and all the   tension of it bow And perhaps also the arrow the duty and who   know THE GOAL TO AIM AT     Sils Maria Upper Engadine JUNE 1885           CHAPTER I PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS       1 The Will to Truth which is to tempt u to many a hazardous   enterprise the famous Truthfulness of which all philosopher have   hitherto spoken with respect what question ha this Will to Truth not   laid before u What strange perplexing questionable question It is   already a long story yet it seems a if it were hardly commenced Is   it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn   impatiently away That this Sphinx teach u at last to ask question   ourselves WHO is it really that put question to u here WHAT really   is this Will to Truth in u In fact we made a long halt at the   question a to the origin of this Willuntil at last we came to an   absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question We inquired   about the VALUE of this Will Granted that we want the truth WHY NOT   RATHER untruth And uncertainty Even ignorance The problem of the   value of truth presented itself before usor wa it we who presented   ourselves before the problem Which of u is the Oedipus here Which   the Sphinx It would seem to be a rendezvous of question and note of   interrogation And could it be believed that it at last seems to u a   if the problem had never been propounded before a if we were the first   to discern it get a sight of it and RISK RAISING it For there is risk   in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk     2 HOW COULD anything originate out of it opposite For example truth   out of error or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception or the   generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sunbright vision of the   wise man out of covetousness Such genesis is impossible whoever dream   of it is a fool nay worse than a fool thing of the highest   value must have a different origin an origin of THEIR ownin this   transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of   delusion and cupidity they can not have their source But rather in   the lap of Being in the intransitory in the concealed God in the   ThinginitselfTHERE must be their source and nowhere elseThis   mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which   metaphysicians of all time can be recognized this mode of valuation   is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of   theirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that   is in the end solemnly christened the Truth The fundamental belief of   metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES It never occurred   even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where   doubt however wa most necessary though they had made a solemn   vow DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM For it may be doubted firstly whether   antithesis exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuation   and antithesis of value upon which metaphysicians have set their   seal are not perhaps merely superficial estimate merely provisional   perspective besides being probably made from some corner perhaps from   belowfrog perspective a it were to borrow an expression current   among painter In spite of all the value which may belong to the true   the positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higher   and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to   pretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity It   might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and   respected thing consists precisely in their being insidiously   related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed   thingsperhaps even in being essentially identical with them Perhaps   But who wish to concern himself with such dangerous Perhapses   For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of   philosopher such a will have other taste and inclination the   reverse of those hitherto prevalentphilosophers of the dangerous   Perhaps in every sense of the term And to speak in all seriousness I   see such new philosopher beginning to appear     3 Having kept a sharp eye on philosopher and having read between   their line long enough I now say to myself that the greater part of   conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive function and   it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one ha here to   learn anew a one learned anew about heredity and innateness As   little a the act of birth come into consideration in the whole process   and procedure of heredity just a little is beingconscious OPPOSED   to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the   conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his   instinct and forced into definite channel And behind all logic and   it seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuation or to speak   more plainly physiological demand for the maintenance of a definite   mode of life For example that the certain is worth more than the   uncertain that illusion is le valuable than truth such valuation   in spite of their regulative importance for US might notwithstanding be   only superficial valuation special kind of niaiserie such a may   be necessary for the maintenance of being such a ourselves Supposing   in effect that man is not just the measure of thing     4 The falseness of an opinion is not for u any objection to it it is   here perhaps that our new language sound most strangely The   question is how far an opinion is lifefurthering lifepreserving   speciespreserving perhaps speciesrearing and we are fundamentally   inclined to maintain that the falsest opinion to which the synthetic   judgment a priori belong are the most indispensable to u that   without a recognition of logical fiction without a comparison of   reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable   without a constant counterfeiting of the world by mean of number   man could not livethat the renunciation of false opinion would be   a renunciation of life a negation of life TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A   CONDITION OF LIFE that is certainly to impugn the traditional idea of   value in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which venture to do so   ha thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil     5 That which cause philosopher to be regarded halfdistrustfully   and halfmockingly is not the oftrepeated discovery how innocent they   arehow often and easily they make mistake and lose their way in   short how childish and childlike they arebut that there is not   enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud and   virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in   the remotest manner They all pose a though their real opinion had   been discovered and attained through the selfevolving of a cold pure   divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sort of mystic   who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact a   prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally   their heart desire abstracted and refined is defended by them with   argument sought out after the event They are all advocate who do not   wish to be regarded a such generally astute defender also of their   prejudice which they dub truthsand VERY far from having the   conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having   the good taste of the courage which go so far a to let this be   understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidence   and selfridicule The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant equally   stiff and decent with which he entices u into the dialectic   byway that lead more correctly mislead to his categorical   imperativemakes u fastidious one smile we who find no small   amusement in spying out the subtle trick of old moralist and ethical   preacher Or still more so the hocuspocus in mathematical form by   mean of which Spinoza ha a it were clad his philosophy in mail and   maskin fact the love of HIS wisdom to translate the term fairly   and squarelyin order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart   of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible   maiden that Pallas Athenehow much of personal timidity and   vulnerability doe this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray     6 It ha gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up   till now ha consisted ofnamely the confession of it originator and   a specie of involuntary and unconscious autobiography and moreover   that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy ha constituted   the true vital germ out of which the entire plant ha always grown   Indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertion of a   philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to first   ask oneself What morality do they or doe he aim at Accordingly   I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of   philosophy but that another impulse here a elsewhere ha only made   use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge a an instrument But whoever   considers the fundamental impulse of man with a view to determining   how far they may have here acted a INSPIRING GENII or a demon and   cobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time   or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to   look upon itself a the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate   LORD over all the other impulse For every impulse is imperious and a   SUCH attempt to philosophize To be sure in the case of scholar in   the case of really scientific men it may be otherwisebetter if   you will there there may really be such a thing a an impulse to   knowledge some kind of small independent clockwork which when well   wound up work away industriously to that end WITHOUT the rest of   the scholarly impulse taking any material part therein The actual   interest of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another   directionin the family perhaps or in moneymaking or in politics   it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little   machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a   good philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist he is not   CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that In the philosopher on the   contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all   his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony a to WHO HE   ISthat is to say in what order the deepest impulse of his nature   stand to each other     7 How malicious philosopher can be I know of nothing more stinging   than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the   Platonists he called them Dionysiokolakes In it original sense   and on the face of it the word signifies Flatterers of   Dionysiusconsequently tyrant accessory and lickspittles   besides this however it is a much a to say They are all ACTORS   there is nothing genuine about them for Dionysiokolax wa a popular   name for an actor And the latter is really the malignant reproach that   Epicurus cast upon Plato he wa annoyed by the grandiose manner the   mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholar were mastersof   which Epicurus wa not a master He the old schoolteacher of Samos   who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens and wrote three   hundred book perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato who   know Greece took a hundred year to find out who the gardengod   Epicurus really wa Did she ever find out     8 There is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of   the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the word of an   ancient mystery     Adventavit asinus Pulcher et fortissimus     9 You desire to LIVE according to Nature Oh you noble Stoics what   fraud of word Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature boundlessly   extravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or consideration   without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain   imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE a a powerhow COULD you live   in accordance with such indifference To liveis not that just   endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature Is not living valuing   preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different   And granted that your imperative living according to Nature mean   actually the same a living according to lifehow could you do   DIFFERENTLY Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves   are and must be In reality however it is quite otherwise with you   while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature   you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stageplayers   and selfdeluders In your pride you wish to dictate your moral and   ideal to Nature to Nature herself and to incorporate them therein   you insist that it shall be Nature according to the Stoa and would   like everything to be made after your own image a a vast eternal   glorification and generalism of Stoicism With all your love for truth   you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such   hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY that is to say Stoically   that you are no longer able to see it otherwiseand to crown all some   unfathomable superciliousness give you the Bedlamite hope that   BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselvesStoicism is   selftyrannyNature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is   not the Stoic a PART of Nature But this is an old and everlasting   story what happened in old time with the Stoics still happens today   a soon a ever a philosophy begin to believe in itself It always   creates the world in it own image it can not do otherwise philosophy   is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual Will to Power the   will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima     10 The eagerness and subtlety I should even say craftiness with   which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at   present throughout Europe furnishes food for thought and attention and   he who hears only a Will to Truth in the background and nothing else   can not certainly boast of the sharpest ear In rare and isolated   case it may really have happened that such a Will to Trutha certain   extravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of the   forlorn hopehas participated therein that which in the end always   prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful   possibility there may even be puritanical fanatic of conscience   who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in an   uncertain something But that is Nihilism and the sign of a despairing   mortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a   virtue may display It seems however to be otherwise with stronger   and livelier thinker who are still eager for life In that they side   AGAINST appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in   that they rank the credibility of their own body about a low a the   credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stand still and   thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession   to escape for what doe one at present believe in more firmly than   in one bodywho know if they are not really trying to win back   something which wa formerly an even securer possession something   of the old domain of the faith of former time perhaps the immortal   soul perhaps the old God in short idea by which they could live   better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by   modern idea There is DISTRUST of these modern idea in this mode   of looking at thing a disbelief in all that ha been constructed   yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety   and scorn which can no longer endure the BRICABRAC of idea of the   most varied origin such a socalled Positivism at present throw on   the market a disgust of the more refined taste at the villagefair   motleyness and patchiness of all these realityphilosophasters in whom   there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness Therein it   seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical antirealists and   knowledgemicroscopists of the present day their instinct which repels   them from MODERN reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde   bypath concern u The main thing about them is NOT that they wish   to go back but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom A little MORE   strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be OFFand   not back     11 It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to   divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on   German philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which   he set upon himself Kant wa first and foremost proud of his Table of   Categories with it in his hand he said This is the most difficult   thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics Let u   only understand this could be He wa proud of having DISCOVERED a   new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori Granting   that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid   flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and   on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible   somethingat all event new facultiesof which to be still   prouderBut let u reflect for a momentit is high time to do so   How are synthetic judgment a priori POSSIBLE Kant asks himselfand   what is really his answer BY MEANS OF A MEANS facultybut   unfortunately not in five word but so circumstantially imposingly   and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourish that   one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved   in such an answer People were beside themselves with delight over this   new faculty and the jubilation reached it climax when Kant further   discovered a moral faculty in manfor at that time Germans were still   moral not yet dabbling in the Politics of hard fact Then came   the honeymoon of German philosophy All the young theologian of the   Tubingen institution went immediately into the grovesall seeking for   faculty And what did they not findin that innocent rich and   still youthful period of the German spirit to which Romanticism the   malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish   between finding and inventing Above all a faculty for the   transcendental Schelling christened it intellectual intuition   and thereby gratified the most earnest longing of the naturally   piousinclined Germans One can do no greater wrong to the whole of   this exuberant and eccentric movement which wa really youthfulness   notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile   conception than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral   indignation Enough howeverthe world grew older and the dream   vanished A time came when people rubbed their forehead and they still   rub them today People had been dreaming and first and foremostold   Kant By mean of a mean facultyhe had said or at least meant to   say But is thatan answer An explanation Or is it not rather merely   a repetition of the question How doe opium induce sleep By mean of   a mean faculty namely the virtu dormitiva reply the doctor in   Moliere         Quia est in eo virtu dormitiva       Cujus est natura sensus assoupire     But such reply belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time   to replace the Kantian question How are synthetic judgment a PRIORI   possible by another question Why is belief in such judgment   necessaryin effect it is high time that we should understand   that such judgment must be believed to be true for the sake of the   preservation of creature like ourselves though they still might   naturally be false judgment Or more plainly spoken and roughly and   readilysynthetic judgment a priori should not be possible at all   we have no right to them in our mouth they are nothing but false   judgment Only of course the belief in their truth is necessary a   plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view   of life And finally to call to mind the enormous influence which   German philosophyI hope you understand it right to inverted comma   goosefeethas exercised throughout the whole of Europe there is   no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it thanks to   German philosophy it wa a delight to the noble idler the virtuous   the mystic the artiste the threefourths Christians and the   political obscurantist of all nation to find an antidote to the still   overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into   this in shortsensus assoupire     12 As regard materialistic atomism it is one of the bestrefuted   theory that have been advanced and in Europe there is now perhaps   no one in the learned world so unscholarly a to attach serious   signification to it except for convenient everyday use a an   abbreviation of the mean of expressionthanks chiefly to the Pole   Boscovich he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest   and most successful opponent of ocular evidence For while Copernicus   ha persuaded u to believe contrary to all the sens that the earth   doe NOT stand fast Boscovich ha taught u to abjure the belief in the   last thing that stood fast of the earththe belief in substance in   matter in the earthresiduum and particleatom it is the greatest   triumph over the sens that ha hitherto been gained on earth One   must however go still further and also declare war relentless war   to the knife against the atomistic requirement which still lead a   dangerous afterlife in place where no one suspect them like the more   celebrated metaphysical requirement one must also above all give   the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which   Christianity ha taught best and longest the SOULATOMISM Let it be   permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regard the   soul a something indestructible eternal indivisible a a monad   a an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science Between   ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby   and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypothesesas   happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalist who can hardly   touch on the soul without immediately losing it But the way is open   for new acceptation and refinement of the soulhypothesis and such   conception a mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity   and soul a social structure of the instinct and passion want   henceforth to have legitimate right in science In that the NEW   psychologist is about to put an end to the superstition which have   hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of   the soul he is really a it were thrusting himself into a new desert   and a new distrustit is possible that the older psychologist had a   merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he find   that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENTand who know   perhaps to DISCOVER the new     13 Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the   instinct of selfpreservation a the cardinal instinct of an organic   being A living thing seek above all to DISCHARGE it strengthlife   itself is WILL TO POWER selfpreservation is only one of the indirect   and most frequent RESULTS thereof In short here a everywhere else   let u beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principlesone of which   is the instinct of selfpreservation we owe it to Spinozas   inconsistency It is thus in effect that method ordains which must   be essentially economy of principle     14 It is perhaps just dawning on five or six mind that natural   philosophy is only a worldexposition and worldarrangement according   to u if I may say so and NOT a worldexplanation but in so far a   it is based on belief in the sens it is regarded a more and for a   long time to come must be regarded a morenamely a an explanation   It ha eye and finger of it own it ha ocular evidence and   palpableness of it own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and   CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastesin fact it   follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism   What is clear what is explained Only that which can be seen and   feltone must pursue every problem thus far Obversely however the   charm of the Platonic mode of thought which wa an ARISTOCRATIC mode   consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious senseevidenceperhaps   among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious sens than our   contemporary but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining   master of them and this by mean of pale cold grey conceptional   network which they threw over the motley whirl of the sensesthe   mob of the sens a Plato said In this overcoming of the world and   interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato there wa an ENJOYMENT   different from that which the physicist of today offer usand likewise   the Darwinists and antiteleologists among the physiological worker   with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest   possible blunder Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there   is also nothing more for men to dothat is certainly an imperative   different from the Platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right   imperative for a hardy laborious race of machinist and bridgebuilders   of the future who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform     15 To study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist on   the fact that the senseorgans are not phenomenon in the sense of the   idealistic philosophy a such they certainly could not be cause   Sensualism therefore at least a regulative hypothesis if not a   heuristic principle What And others say even that the external world   is the work of our organ But then our body a a part of this external   world would be the work of our organ But then our organ themselves   would be the work of our organ It seems to me that this is a   complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM if the conception CAUSA SUI is something   fundamentally absurd Consequently the external world is NOT the work   of our organ     16 There are still harmless selfobservers who believe that there are   immediate certainty for instance I think or a the superstition   of Schopenhauer put it I will a though cognition here got hold   of it object purely and simply a the thing in itself without any   falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the   object I would repeat it however a hundred time that immediate   certainty a well a absolute knowledge and the thing in itself   involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO we really ought to free ourselves   from the misleading significance of word The people on their part may   think that cognition is knowing all about thing but the philosopher   must say to himself When I analyze the process that is expressed in   the sentence I think I find a whole series of daring assertion the   argumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible   for instance that it is I who think that there must necessarily be   something that think that thinking is an activity and operation on the   part of a being who is thought of a a cause that there is an ego   and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by   thinkingthat I KNOW what thinking is For if I had not already decided   within myself what it is by what standard could I determine whether   that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling In   short the assertion I think assumes that I COMPARE my state at the   present moment with other state of myself which I know in order to   determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with   further knowledge it ha at any rate no immediate certainty for   meIn place of the immediate certainty in which the people may   believe in the special case the philosopher thus find a series of   metaphysical question presented to him veritable conscience question   of the intellect to wit Whence did I get the notion of thinking   Why do I believe in cause and effect What give me the right to speak   of an ego and even of an ego a cause and finally of an ego   a cause of thought He who venture to answer these metaphysical   question at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception like   the person who say I think and know that this at least is   true actual and certainwill encounter a smile and two note of   interrogation in a philosopher nowadays Sir the philosopher will   perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not   mistaken but why should it be the truth     17 With regard to the superstition of logician I shall never tire   of emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by   these credulous mindsnamely that a thought come when it wish   and not when I wish so that it is a PERVERSION of the fact of the   case to say that the subject I is the condition of the predicate   think ONE think but that this one is precisely the famous old   ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and   assuredly not an immediate certainty After all one ha even gone too   far with this one thinkseven the one contains an INTERPRETATION of   the process and doe not belong to the process itself One infers here   according to the usual grammatical formulaTo think is an activity   every activity requires an agency that is active consequently It   wa pretty much on the same line that the older atomism sought besides   the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out   of which it operatesthe atom More rigorous mind however learnt at   last to get along without this earthresiduum and perhaps some day we   shall accustom ourselves even from the logician point of view to   get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego ha   refined itself     18 It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is   refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle   mind It seems that the hundredtimesrefuted theory of the free will   owes it persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing   who feel himself strong enough to refute it     19 Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will a though it were   the bestknown thing in the world indeed Schopenhauer ha given u   to understand that the will alone is really known to u absolutely and   completely known without deduction or addition But it again and   again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what   philosopher are in the habit of doinghe seems to have adopted a   POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it Willing seems to me to be above   all something COMPLICATED something that is a unity only in nameand   it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which ha got   the mastery over the inadequate precaution of philosopher in all age   So let u for once be more cautious let u be unphilosophical let   u say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensation   namely the sensation of the condition AWAY FROM WHICH we go the   sensation of the condition TOWARDS WHICH we go the sensation of this   FROM and TOWARDS itself and then besides an accompanying muscular   sensation which even without our putting in motion arm and leg   commences it action by force of habit directly we will anything   Therefore just a sensation and indeed many kind of sensation are   to be recognized a ingredient of the will so in the second place   thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is   a ruling thoughtand let u not imagine it possible to sever this   thought from the willing a if the will would then remain over   In the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation and   thinking but it is above all an EMOTION and in fact the emotion of the   command That which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the   emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey I am free he   must obeythis consciousness is inherent in every will and equally   so the straining of the attention the straight look which fix itself   exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and   nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience   will be renderedand whatever else pertains to the position of the   commander A man who WILLS command something within himself which   render obedience or which he belief render obedience But now let   u notice what is the strangest thing about the willthis affair so   extremely complex for which the people have only one name Inasmuch a   in the given circumstance we are at the same time the commanding AND   the obeying party and a the obeying party we know the sensation of   constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually   commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch a on the other   hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive   ourselves about it by mean of the synthetic term I a whole series   of erroneous conclusion and consequently of false judgment about the   will itself ha become attached to the act of willingto such a degree   that he who will belief firmly that willing SUFFICES for action   Since in the majority of case there ha only been exercise of will   when the effect of the commandconsequently obedience and therefore   actionwas to be EXPECTED the APPEARANCE ha translated itself into   the sentiment a if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT in a word he who   will belief with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are   somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing   to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation   of power which accompanies all success Freedom of Willthat is the   expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising   volition who command and at the same time identifies himself with   the executor of the orderwho a such enjoys also the triumph over   obstacle but think within himself that it wa really his own will   that overcame them In this way the person exercising volition add the   feeling of delight of his successful executive instrument the useful   underwills or undersoulsindeed our body is but a social structure   composed of many soulsto his feeling of delight a commander LEFFET   CEST MOI what happens here is what happens in every wellconstructed   and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifies   itself with the success of the commonwealth In all willing it is   absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis a   already said of a social structure composed of many soul on which   account a philosopher should claim the right to include willingassuch   within the sphere of moralsregarded a the doctrine of the relation   of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifest itself     20 That the separate philosophical idea are not anything optional or   autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with   each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear   in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just a much to   a system a the collective member of the fauna of a Continentis   betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most   diverse philosopher always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme   of POSSIBLE philosophy Under an invisible spell they always revolve   once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they   may feel themselves with their critical or systematic will something   within them lead them something impels them in definite order the   one after the otherto wit the innate methodology and relationship   of their idea Their thinking is in fact far le a discovery than a   rerecognizing a remembering a return and a homecoming to a faroff   ancient commonhousehold of the soul out of which those idea formerly   grew philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order   The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian Greek and German   philosophizing is easily enough explained In fact where there is   affinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammarI mean   owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical   functionsit can not but be that everything is prepared at the outset   for a similar development and succession of philosophical system   just a the way seems barred against certain other possibility of   worldinterpretation It is highly probable that philosopher within the   domain of the UralAltaic language where the conception of the subject   is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be   found on path of thought different from those of the IndoGermans and   Mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical function is ultimately   also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuation and racial conditionsSo   much by way of rejecting Lockes superficiality with regard to the   origin of idea     21 The CAUSA SUI is the best selfcontradiction that ha yet been   conceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the   extravagant pride of man ha managed to entangle itself profoundly and   frightfully with this very folly The desire for freedom of will   in the superlative metaphysical sense such a still hold sway   unfortunately in the mind of the halfeducated the desire to bear   the entire and ultimate responsibility for one action oneself and   to absolve God the world ancestor chance and society therefrom   involves nothing le than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI and with   more than Munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the   hair out of the slough of nothingness If any one should find out in   this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free   will and put it out of his head altogether I beg of him to carry   his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the   contrary of this monstrous conception of free will I mean nonfree   will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect One   should not wrongly MATERIALISE cause and effect a the natural   philosopher do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at   present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which make   the cause press and push until it effect it end one should use   cause and effect only a pure CONCEPTIONS that is to say a   conventional fiction for the purpose of designation and mutual   understandingNOT for explanation In beinginitself there is   nothing of casualconnection of necessity or of psychological   nonfreedom there the effect doe NOT follow the cause there law   doe not obtain It is WE alone who have devised cause sequence   reciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motive   and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this symbolworld   a beinginitself with thing we act once more a we have always   actedMYTHOLOGICALLY The nonfree will is mythology in real life   it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK willsIt is almost always   a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in every   causalconnection and psychological necessity manifest something   of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and nonfreedom   it is suspicious to have such feelingsthe person betrays himself And   in general if I have observed correctly the nonfreedom of the will   is regarded a a problem from two entirely opposite standpoint but   always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner some will not give up their   responsibility their belief in THEMSELVES the personal right to   THEIR merit at any price the vain race belong to this class others   on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed   for anything and owing to an inward selfcontempt seek to GET OUT OF   THE BUSINESS no matter how The latter when they write book are   in the habit at present of taking the side of criminal a sort of   socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise And a a matter of   fact the fatalism of the weakwilled embellishes itself surprisingly   when it can pose a la religion de la souffrance humaine that is ITS   good taste     22 Let me be pardoned a an old philologist who can not desist from   the mischief of putting his finger on bad mode of interpretation but   Natures conformity to law of which you physicist talk so proudly   a thoughwhy it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad   philology It is no matter of fact no text but rather just a   naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which   you make abundant concession to the democratic instinct of the modern   soul Everywhere equality before the lawNature is not different in   that respect nor better than we a fine instance of secret motive   in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and   autocraticlikewise a second and more refined atheismis once more   disguised Ni dieu ni maitrethat also is what you want and   therefore Cheers for natural lawis it not so But a ha been   said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along   who with opposite intention and mode of interpretation could read   out of the same Nature and with regard to the same phenomenon just   the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claim   of poweran interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and   unconditionalness of all Will to Power before your eye that almost   every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem   unsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphoras being too   human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about   this world a you do namely that it ha a necessary and calculable   course NOT however because law obtain in it but because they are   absolutely LACKING and every power effect it ultimate consequence   every moment Granted that this also is only interpretationand you   will be eager enough to make this objectionwell so much the better     23 All psychology hitherto ha run aground on moral prejudice and   timidity it ha not dared to launch out into the depth In so far   a it is allowable to recognize in that which ha hitherto been written   evidence of that which ha hitherto been kept silent it seems a if   nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology a the Morphology   and DEVELOPMENTDOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER a I conceive of it   The power of moral prejudice ha penetrated deeply into the most   intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and   unprejudiced and ha obviously operated in an injurious obstructive   blinding and distorting manner A proper physiopsychology ha to   contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator   it ha the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal   conditionalness of the good and the bad impulse cause a   refined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manly   consciencestill more so a doctrine of the derivation of all good   impulse from bad one If however a person should regard even   the emotion of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness   a lifeconditioning emotion a factor which must be present   fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which   must therefore be further developed if life is to be further   developed he will suffer from such a view of thing a from   seasickness And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest   and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous   knowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reason why every one   should keep away from it who CAN do so On the other hand if one ha   once drifted hither with one bark well very good now let u set our   teeth firmly let u open our eye and keep our hand fast on the helm   We sail away right OVER morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the   remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thitherbut   what do WE matter Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal   itself to daring traveler and adventurer and the psychologist who   thus make a sacrificeit is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto   on the contrarywill at least be entitled to demand in return that   psychology shall once more be recognized a the queen of the science   for whose service and equipment the other science exist For psychology   is once more the path to the fundamental problem         CHAPTER II THE FREE SPIRIT       24 O sanctum simplicitas In what strange simplification and   falsification man life One can never cease wondering when once one ha   got eye for beholding this marvel How we have made everything around   u clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give   our sens a passport to everything superficial our thought a godlike   desire for wanton prank and wrong inferenceshow from the beginning   we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost   inconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartiness   and gaietyin order to enjoy life And only on this solidified   granitelike foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself   hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful   will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue Not a   it opposite butas it refinement It is to be hoped indeed that   LANGUAGE here a elsewhere will not get over it awkwardness and that   it will continue to talk of opposite where there are only degree   and many refinement of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the   incarnated Tartuffery of moral which now belongs to our unconquerable   flesh and blood will turn the word round in the mouth of u   discerning one Here and there we understand it and laugh at the way   in which precisely the best knowledge seek most to retain u in this   SIMPLIFIED thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitably   falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it love   error because a living itself it love life     25 After such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be   heard it appeal to the most serious mind Take care ye philosopher   and friend of knowledge and beware of martyrdom Of suffering for the   truth sake even in your own defense It spoil all the innocence   and fine neutrality of your conscience it make you headstrong against   objection and red rag it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when   in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even   worse consequence of enmity ye have at last to play your last card   a protector of truth upon earthas though the Truth were such an   innocent and incompetent creature a to require protector and you of   all people ye knight of the sorrowful countenance Messrs Loafers and   Cobwebspinners of the spirit Finally ye know sufficiently well that   it can not be of any consequence if YE just carry your point ye know   that hitherto no philosopher ha carried his point and that there might   be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark   which you place after your special word and favourite doctrine and   occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and   trumping game before accuser and lawcourt Rather go out of the way   Flee into concealment And have your mask and your rus that ye may   be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared And pray do nt forget   the garden the garden with golden trelliswork And have people around   you who are a a gardenor a music on the water at eventide when   already the day becomes a memory Choose the GOOD solitude the free   wanton lightsome solitude which also give you the right still to   remain good in any sense whatsoever How poisonous how crafty how bad   doe every long war make one which can not be waged openly by mean   of force How PERSONAL doe a long fear make one a long watching   of enemy of possible enemy These pariah of society these   longpursued badlypersecuted onesalso the compulsory recluse the   Spinozas or Giordano Brunosalways become in the end even under the   most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware   of it refined vengeanceseekers and poisonBrewers just lay bare   the foundation of Spinozas ethic and theology not to speak of   the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a   philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour ha left him The   martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth   force into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him   and if one ha hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity   with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous   desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a   martyr into a stageandtribunebawler Only that it is necessary   with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any   casemerely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the   continued proof that the long real tragedy IS AT AN END supposing that   every philosophy ha been a long tragedy in it origin     26 Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy   where he is FREE from the crowd the many the majoritywhere he may   forget men who are the rule a their exceptionexclusive only of   the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger   instinct a a discerner in the great and exceptional sense Whoever in   intercourse with men doe not occasionally glisten in all the green   and grey colour of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy   gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated taste   supposing however that he doe not voluntarily take all this burden   and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains   a I said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then   certain he wa not made he wa not predestined for knowledge For a   such he would one day have to say to himself The devil take my good   taste but the rule is more interesting than the exceptionthan   myself the exception And he would go DOWN and above all he would   go inside The long and serious study of the AVERAGE manand   consequently much disguise selfovercoming familiarity and bad   intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one   equalsthat constitutes a necessary part of the lifehistory of every   philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing   part If he is fortunate however a a favourite child of knowledge   should be he will meet with suitable auxiliary who will shorten and   lighten his task I mean socalled cynic those who simply recognize   the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the   same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness a to make them   talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSESsometimes they   wallow even in book a on their own dunghill Cynicism is the only   form in which base soul approach what is called honesty and the   higher man must open his ear to all the coarser or finer cynicism and   congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before   him or the scientific satyr speaks out There are even case where   enchantment mix with the disgustnamely where by a freak of nature   genius is bound to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape a in the   case of the Abbe Galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also   filthiest man of his centuryhe wa far profounder than Voltaire and   consequently also a good deal more silent It happens more frequently   a ha been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an ape body a   fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no mean   rare especially among doctor and moral physiologist And whenever   anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man   a a belly with two requirement and a head with one whenever any one   see seek and WANTS to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity   a the real and only motif of human action in short when any one   speaks badlyand not even illof man then ought the lover of   knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general   to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation For the   indignant man and he who perpetually tear and lacerates himself with   his own teeth or in place of himself the world God or society   may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and   selfsatisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary   more indifferent and le instructive case And no one is such a LIAR   a the indignant man     27 It is difficult to be understood especially when one think and   life gangasrotogati Footnote Like the river Ganges presto among   those only who think and live otherwisenamely kurmagati Footnote   Like the tortoise lento or at best froglike mandeikagati   Footnote Like the frog staccato I do everything to be difficultly   understood myselfand one should be heartily grateful for the   good will to some refinement of interpretation As regard the good   friend however who are always too easygoing and think that a   friend they have a right to ease one doe well at the very first to   grant them a playground and rompingplace for misunderstandingone can   thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good friendsand   laugh then also     28 What is most difficult to render from one language into another   is the TEMPO of it style which ha it basis in the character of the   race or to speak more physiologically in the average TEMPO of the   assimilation of it nutriment There are honestly meant translation   which a involuntary vulgarization are almost falsification of the   original merely because it lively and merry TEMPO which overleaps and   obviates all danger in word and expression could not also be   rendered A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language   consequently also a may be reasonably inferred for many of the most   delightful and daring NUANCES of free freespirited thought And just   a the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience   so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him Everything   ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all longwinded and wearying   specie of style are developed in profuse variety among Germanspardon   me for stating the fact that even Goethes prose in it mixture of   stiffness and elegance is no exception a a reflection of the good   old time to which it belongs and a an expression of German taste at a   time when there wa still a German taste which wa a rococotaste   in moribus et artibus Lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic   nature which understood much and wa versed in many thing he who wa   not the translator of Bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in   the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire and still more willingly among the   Roman comedywritersLessing loved also freespiritism in the TEMPO   and flight out of Germany But how could the German language even   in the prose of Lessing imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli who in his   Principe make u breathe the dry fine air of Florence and can not   help presenting the most serious event in a boisterous allegrissimo   perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he   venture to presentlong heavy difficult dangerous thought and   a TEMPO of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour Finally who   would venture on a German translation of Petronius who more than any   great musician hitherto wa a master of PRESTO in invention idea and   word What matter in the end about the swamp of the sick evil world   or of the ancient world when like him one ha the foot of a wind   the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which make   everything healthy by making everything RUN And with regard to   Aristophanesthat transfiguring complementary genius for whose   sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed provided one ha   understood in it full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and   transfiguration there is nothing that ha caused me to meditate more on   PLATOS secrecy and sphinxlike nature than the happily preserved petit   fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there wa found no   Bible nor anything Egyptian Pythagorean or Platonicbut a book of   Aristophanes How could even Plato have endured lifea Greek life which   he repudiatedwithout an Aristophanes     29 It is the business of the very few to be independent it is a   privilege of the strong And whoever attempt it even with the best   right but without being OBLIGED to do so prof that he is probably   not only strong but also daring beyond measure He enters into a   labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the danger which life in itself   already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see   how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal   by some minotaur of conscience Supposing such a one come to grief it   is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor   sympathize with it And he can not any longer go back He can not even go   back again to the sympathy of men     30 Our deepest insight mustand shouldappear a folly and under   certain circumstance a crime when they come unauthorizedly to   the ear of those who are not disposed and predestined for them The   exoteric and the esoteric a they were formerly distinguished by   philosophersamong the Indians a among the Greeks Persians and   Mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradation of rank and   NOT in equality and equal rightsare not so much in contradistinction   to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and   viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not   from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in   question view thing from below upwardswhile the esoteric class view   thing FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS There are height of the soul from which   tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically and if all the   woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether   the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy and   thus to a doubling of the woe That which serf the higher class of   men for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely   different and lower order of human being The virtue of the common   man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher it might be   possible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go   to ruin to acquire quality thereby alone for the sake of which he   would have to be honoured a a saint in the lower world into which he   had sunk There are book which have an inverse value for the soul and   the health according a the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the   higher and more powerful make use of them In the former case they are   dangerous disturbing unsettling book in the latter case they are   heraldcalls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery Books for the   general reader are always illsmelling book the odour of paltry people   cling to them Where the populace eat and drink and even where they   reverence it is accustomed to stink One should not go into church if   one wish to breathe PURE air     31 In our youthful year we still venerate and despise without the art   of NUANCE which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to do   hard penance for having fallen upon men and thing with Yea and Nay   Everything is so arranged that the worst of all taste THE TASTE FOR   THE UNCONDITIONAL is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learns   to introduce a little art into his sentiment and prefers to try   conclusion with the artificial a do the real artist of life The   angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no   peace until it ha suitably falsified men and thing to be able   to vent it passion upon them youth in itself even is something   falsifying and deceptive Later on when the young soul tortured by   continual disillusion finally turn suspiciously against itselfstill   ardent and savage even in it suspicion and remorse of conscience how   it upbraids itself how impatiently it tear itself how it revenge   itself for it long selfblinding a though it had been a voluntary   blindness In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one   sentiment one torture one enthusiasm with doubt one feel even the   good conscience to be a danger a if it were the selfconcealment and   lassitude of a more refined uprightness and above all one espouses   upon principle the cause AGAINST youthA decade later and one   comprehends that all this wa also stillyouth     32 Throughout the longest period of human historyone call it the   prehistoric periodthe value or nonvalue of an action wa inferred   from it CONSEQUENCES the action in itself wa not taken into   consideration any more than it origin but pretty much a in China at   present where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to   it parent the retrooperating power of success or failure wa what   induced men to think well or ill of an action Let u call this period   the PREMORAL period of mankind the imperative Know thyself wa   then still unknownIn the last ten thousand year on the other hand   on certain large portion of the earth one ha gradually got so far   that one no longer let the consequence of an action but it origin   decide with regard to it worth a great achievement a a whole an   important refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect   of the supremacy of aristocratic value and of the belief in origin   the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense a   the MORAL one the first attempt at selfknowledge is thereby   made Instead of the consequence the originwhat an inversion   of perspective And assuredly an inversion effected only after long   struggle and wavering To be sure an ominous new superstition a   peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely   thereby the origin of an action wa interpreted in the most definite   sense possible a origin out of an INTENTION people were agreed in the   belief that the value of an action lay in the value of it intention   The intention a the sole origin and antecedent history of an action   under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been   bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the   present dayIs it not possible however that the necessity may now   have arisen of again making up our mind with regard to the reversing   and fundamental shifting of value owing to a new selfconsciousness   and acuteness in manis it not possible that we may be standing on   the threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguished   negatively a ULTRAMORAL nowadays when at least among u immoralists   the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lie precisely   in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL and that all it intentionalness all   that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to it surface or   skinwhich like every skin betrays something but CONCEALS still   more In short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom   which first requires an explanationa sign moreover which ha too   many interpretation and consequently hardly any meaning in itself   alone that morality in the sense in which it ha been understood   hitherto a intentionmorality ha been a prejudice perhaps a   prematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rank   a astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be   surmounted The surmounting of morality in a certain sense even the   selfmounting of moralitylet that be the name for the longsecret   labour which ha been reserved for the most refined the most upright   and also the most wicked conscience of today a the living touchstone   of the soul     33 It can not be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice for   one neighbour and all selfrenunciationmorality must be mercilessly   called to account and brought to judgment just a the aesthetic   of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art   nowadays seek insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience   There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiment for others   and NOT for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here   and for one asking promptly Are they not perhapsDECEPTIONSThat   they PLEASEhim who ha them and him who enjoys their fruit and also   the mere spectatorthat is still no argument in their FAVOUR but just   call for caution Let u therefore be cautious     34 At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays   seen from every position the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we   think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eye can light   upon we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure u into   surmise concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of thing   He however who make thinking itself and consequently the spirit   responsible for the falseness of the worldan honourable exit which   every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avail himself ofhe   who regard this world including space time form and movement a   falsely DEDUCED would have at least good reason in the end to become   distrustful also of all thinking ha it not hitherto been playing upon   u the worst of scurvy trick and what guarantee would it give that   it would not continue to do what it ha always been doing In all   seriousness the innocence of thinker ha something touching and   respectinspiring in it which even nowadays permit them to wait upon   consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answer   for example whether it be real or not and why it keep the outer   world so resolutely at a distance and other question of the same   description The belief in immediate certainty is a MORAL NAIVETE   which doe honour to u philosopher butwe have now to cease being   MERELY moral men Apart from morality such belief is a folly which   doe little honour to u If in middleclass life an everready distrust   is regarded a the sign of a bad character and consequently a an   imprudence here among u beyond the middleclass world and it Yeas   and Nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the   philosopher ha at length a RIGHT to bad character a the being who   ha hitherto been most befooled on earthhe is now under OBLIGATION   to distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of   suspicionForgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of   expression for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate   differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and I keep at   least a couple of poke in the rib ready for the blind rage with which   philosopher struggle against being deceived Why NOT It is nothing   more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it   is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world So much must be   conceded there could have been no life at all except upon the basis   of perspective estimate and semblance and if with the virtuous   enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosopher one wished to do away   altogether with the seeming worldwell granted that YOU could do   thatat least nothing of your truth would thereby remain Indeed   what is it that force u in general to the supposition that there is an   essential opposition of true and false Is it not enough to suppose   degree of seemingness and a it were lighter and darker shade and   tone of semblancedifferent valeurs a the painter say Why might   not the world WHICH CONCERNS USbe a fiction And to any one who   suggested But to a fiction belongs an originatormight it not be   bluntly replied WHY May not this belong also belong to the fiction   Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the   subject just a towards the predicate and object Might not the   philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar All respect   to governess but is it not time that philosophy should renounce   governessfaith     35 O Voltaire O humanity O idiocy There is something ticklish in   the truth and in the SEARCH for the truth and if man go about it   too humanelyil ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bienI wager he   find nothing     36 Supposing that nothing else is given a real but our world of   desire and passion that we can not sink or rise to any other reality   but just that of our impulsesfor thinking is only a relation of these   impulse to one anotherare we not permitted to make the attempt and   to ask the question whether this which is given doe not SUFFICE by   mean of our counterpart for the understanding even of the socalled   mechanical or material world I do not mean a an illusion a   semblance a representation in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian   sense but a possessing the same degree of reality a our emotion   themselvesas a more primitive form of the world of emotion in   which everything still lie locked in a mighty unity which afterwards   branch off and develops itself in organic process naturally also   refines and debilitatesas a kind of instinctive life in which all   organic function including selfregulation assimilation nutrition   secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with   one anotheras a PRIMARY FORM of lifeIn the end it is not only   permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of   LOGICAL METHOD Not to assume several kind of causality so long a   the attempt to get along with a single one ha not been pushed to it   furthest extent to absurdity if I may be allowed to say so that is   a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadaysit follows   from it definition a mathematician say The question is ultimately   whether we really recognize the will a OPERATING whether we believe in   the causality of the will if we do soand fundamentally our belief IN   THIS is just our belief in causality itselfwe MUST make the attempt   to posit hypothetically the causality of the will a the only causality   Will can naturally only operate on willand not on matter not   on nerve for instance in short the hypothesis must be   hazarded whether will doe not operate on will wherever effect   are recognizedand whether all mechanical action inasmuch a a power   operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will   Granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive   life a the development and ramification of one fundamental form of   willnamely the Will to Power a my thesis put it granted that all   organic function could be traced back to this Will to Power and that   the solution of the problem of generation and nutritionit is one   problemcould also be found therein one would thus have acquired the   right to define ALL active force unequivocally a WILL TO POWER The   world seen from within the world defined and designated according to   it intelligible characterit would simply be Will to Power and   nothing else     37 What Does not that mean in popular language God is disproved but   not the devilOn the contrary On the contrary my friend And who   the devil also compels you to speak popularly     38 As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern time with   the French Revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous when   judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary   spectator of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own   indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately UNTIL THE TEXT HAS   DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION so a noble posterity might once   more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make   ITS aspect endurableOr rather ha not this already happened Have   not we ourselves beenthat noble posterity And in so far a we now   comprehend this is it notthereby already past     39 Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine a true merely because   it make people happy or virtuousexcepting perhaps the amiable   Idealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful   and let all kind of motley coarse and goodnatured desirability   swim about promiscuously in their pond Happiness and virtue are no   argument It is willingly forgotten however even on the part of   thoughtful mind that to make unhappy and to make bad are just a   little counterargument A thing could be TRUE although it were in   the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental   constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full   knowledge of itso that the strength of a mind might be measured by   the amount of truth it could endureor to speak more plainly by the   extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped   and falsified But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain   PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably   situated and have a greater likelihood of success not to speak of the   wicked who are happya specie about whom moralist are silent Perhaps   severity and craft are more favourable condition for the development of   strong independent spirit and philosopher than the gentle refined   yielding goodnature and habit of taking thing easily which are   prized and rightly prized in a learned man Presupposing always   to begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to the   philosopher who writes book or even introduces HIS philosophy into   booksStendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the   freespirited philosopher which for the sake of German taste I will   not omit to underlinefor it is OPPOSED to German taste Pour etre   bon philosophe say this last great psychologist il faut etre sec   clair sans illusion Un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du   caractere requis pour faire de decouvertes en philosophie cestadire   pour voir clair dans ce qui est     40 Everything that is profound love the mask the profoundest thing   have a hatred even of figure and likeness Should not the CONTRARY only   be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in A question   worth askingit would be strange if some mystic ha not already   ventured on the same kind of thing There are proceeding of such a   delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness   and make them unrecognizable there are action of love and of an   extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take   a stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his   recollection Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in   order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret   shame is inventive They are not the worst thing of which one is   most ashamed there is not only deceit behind a maskthere is so much   goodness in craft I could imagine that a man with something costly and   fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like   an old green heavilyhooped winecask the refinement of his shame   requiring it to be so A man who ha depth in his shame meet his   destiny and his delicate decision upon path which few ever reach   and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate   friend may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their   eye and equally so his regained security Such a hidden nature   which instinctively employ speech for silence and concealment and is   inexhaustible in evasion of communication DESIRES and insists that a   mask of himself shall occupy his place in the heart and head of his   friend and supposing he doe not desire it his eye will some day be   opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him thereand   that it is well to be so Every profound spirit need a mask nay more   around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing to   the constantly false that is to say SUPERFICIAL interpretation   of every word he utters every step he take every sign of life he   manifest     41 One must subject oneself to one own test that one is destined   for independence and command and do so at the right time One must not   avoid one test although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous   game one can play and are in the end test made only before ourselves   and before no other judge Not to cleave to any person be it even the   dearestevery person is a prison and also a recess Not to cleave to   a fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitousit is even   le difficult to detach one heart from a victorious fatherland Not   to cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiar   torture and helplessness chance ha given u an insight Not to cleave   to a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discovery   apparently specially reserved for u Not to cleave to one own   liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which   always fly further aloft in order always to see more under itthe   danger of the flier Not to cleave to our own virtue nor become a   a whole a victim to any of our specialty to our hospitality for   instance which is the danger of danger for highly developed   and wealthy soul who deal prodigally almost indifferently with   themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes   a vice One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELFthe best test of   independence     42 A new order of philosopher is appearing I shall venture to baptize   them by a name not without danger As far a I understand them a far   a they allow themselves to be understoodfor it is their nature to   WISH to remain something of a puzzlethese philosopher of the   future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated a   tempter This name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be   preferred a temptation     43 Will they be new friend of truth these coming philosopher Very   probably for all philosopher hitherto have loved their truth But   assuredly they will not be dogmatist It must be contrary to their   pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still   be truth for every onethat which ha hitherto been the secret wish   and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic effort My opinion is MY opinion   another person ha not easily a right to itsuch a philosopher of the   future will say perhaps One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to   agree with many people Good is no longer good when one neighbour   take it into his mouth And how could there be a common good The   expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of   small value In the end thing must be a they are and have always   beenthe great thing remain for the great the abyss for the   profound the delicacy and thrill for the refined and to sum up   shortly everything rare for the rare       44 Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free VERY   free spirit these philosopher of the futureas certainly also they   will not be merely free spirit but something more higher greater   and fundamentally different which doe not wish to be misunderstood and   mistaken But while I say this I feel under OBLIGATION almost a much   to them a to ourselves we free spirit who are their herald and   forerunner to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old   prejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog ha too long made the   conception of free spirit obscure In every country of Europe and the   same in America there is at present something which make an abuse of   this name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirit   who desire almost the opposite of what our intention and instinct   promptnot to mention that in respect to the NEW philosopher who are   appearing they must still more be closed window and bolted door   Briefly and regrettably they belong to the LEVELLERS these wrongly   named free spiritsas glibtongued and

ought to be denied only they   are not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in their   innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and   failure in the old form in

grown most vigorously believe that this ha always taken place under   the opposite condition that for this end the dangerousness of his   situation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty

hitherto attained the height depth and distance of these   experience the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME   and it still unexhausted possibility this is the preordained   huntingdomain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt But   how often must he say despairingly to himself A single individual   ala only a single individual and this great forest this virgin   forest So he would like to have some hundred of hunting assistant   and fine trained hound that he could send into the history of the   human soul to drive HIS game together In vain again and again he   experience profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to find   assistant and dog for all the thing that directly excite his   curiosity The evil of sending scholar into new and dangerous   huntingdomains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense   are required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the BIG   hunt and also the great danger commencesit is precisely then that   they lose their keen eye and nose In order for instance to divine and   determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE   ha hitherto had in the soul of homines religiosi a person would   perhaps himself have to posse a profound a bruised a immense an   experience a the intellectual conscience of Pascal and then he would   still require that widespread heaven of clear wicked spirituality   which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively   formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiencesBut who   could do me this service And who would have time to wait for such   servantsthey evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at   all time Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know   something which mean that one ha MUCH to doBut a curiosity like   mine is once for all the most agreeable of vicespardon me I mean to   say that the love of truth ha it reward in heaven and already upon   earth     46 Faith such a early Christianity desired and not infrequently   achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly freespirited world   which had century of struggle between philosophical school behind   it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which   the Imperium Romanum gavethis faith is NOT that sincere austere   slavefaith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell or some other   northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and   Christianity it is much rather the faith of Pascal which resembles in   a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reasona tough longlived   wormlike reason which is not to be slain at once and with a single   blow The Christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrifice   of all freedom all pride all selfconfidence of spirit it is at   the same time subjection selfderision and selfmutilation There is   cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to a   tender manysided and very fastidious conscience it take for granted   that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL that all the   past and all the habit of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum in   the form of which faith come to it Modern men with their obtuseness   a regard all Christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for the   terribly superlative conception which wa implied to an antique taste by   the paradox of the formula God on the Cross Hitherto there had never   and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so   dreadful questioning and questionable a this formula it promised a   transvaluation of all ancient valuesIt wa the Orient the PROFOUND   Orient it wa the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and it   noble lightminded toleration on the Roman Catholicism of nonfaith   and it wa always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the   halfstoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith   which made the slave indignant at their master and revolt against   them Enlightenment cause revolt for the slave desire the   unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in moral   he love a he hate without NUANCE to the very depth to the point   of pain to the point of sicknesshis many HIDDEN suffering make   him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering The   skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of   aristocratic morality wa not the least of the cause also of the   last great slaveinsurrection which began with the French Revolution     47 Wherever the religious neurosis ha appeared on the earth so far   we find it connected with three dangerous prescription a to regimen   solitude fasting and sexual abstinencebut without it being possible   to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or IF   any relation at all of cause and effect exists there This latter doubt   is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptom among   savage a well a among civilized people is the most sudden and   excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into   penitential paroxysm worldrenunciation and willrenunciation both   symptom perhaps explainable a disguised epilepsy But nowhere is it   MORE obligatory to put aside explanation around no other type ha there   grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems to   have been more interesting to men and even to philosophersperhaps it   is time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution or   better still to look AWAY TO GO AWAYYet in the background of the   most recent philosophy that of Schopenhauer we find almost a the   problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious   crisis and awakening How is the negation of will POSSIBLE how is the   saint possiblethat seems to have been the very question with which   Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher And thus it wa a   genuine Schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent   perhaps also his last a far a Germany is concerned namely Richard   Wagner should bring his own lifework to an end just here and should   finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage a Kundry   type vecu and a it loved and lived at the very time that the   maddoctors in almost all European country had an opportunity to study   the type close at hand wherever the religious neurosisor a I call   it the religious moodmade it latest epidemical outbreak and   display a the Salvation ArmyIf it be a question however a to   what ha been so extremely interesting to men of all sort in all age   and even to philosopher in the whole phenomenon of the saint it   is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous thereinnamely the   immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES of state of the soul regarded a   morally antithetical it wa believed here to be selfevident that   a bad man wa all at once turned into a saint a good man The   hitherto existing psychology wa wrecked at this point is it not   possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed   itself under the dominion of moral because it BELIEVED in opposition   of moral value and saw read and INTERPRETED these opposition   into the text and fact of the case What Miracle only an error of   interpretation A lack of philology     48 It seems that the Latin race are far more deeply attached to their   Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally and   that consequently unbelief in Catholic country mean something quite   different from what it doe among Protestantsnamely a sort of revolt   against the spirit of the race while with u it is rather a return to   the spirit or nonspirit of the race     We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous race even   a regard our talent for religionwe have POOR talent for it One   may make an exception in the case of the Celts who have theretofore   furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North the   Christian ideal blossomed forth in France a much a ever the pale sun   of the north would allow it How strangely pious for our taste are still   these later French skeptic whenever there is any Celtic blood in their   origin How Catholic how unGerman doe Auguste Comtes Sociology   seem to u with the Roman logic of it instinct How Jesuitical that   amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal SainteBeuve in spite of all   his hostility to Jesuits And even Ernest Renan how inaccessible to   u Northerners doe the language of such a Renan appear in whom   every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throw his refined   voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off it balance Let u repeat   after him these fine sentencesand what wickedness and haughtiness is   immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably le beautiful but   harder soul that is to say in our more German soulsDISONS DONC   HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT

religious life of the ancient   Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours   forthit is a very superior kind of man who take SUCH an attitude   towards nature and lifeLater on when the populace got the upper hand   in Greece FEAR became rampant also in religion and Christianity wa   preparing itself     50 The passion for God there are churlish honesthearted and   importunate kind of it like that of Lutherthe whole of Protestantism   lack the southern DELICATEZZA There is an Oriental exaltation of the   mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave a   in the case of St Augustine for instance who lack in an offensive   manner all nobility in bearing and desire There is a feminine   tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs   for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA a in the case of Madame de Guyon In   many case it appears curiously enough a the disguise of a girl   or youth puberty here and there even a the hysteria of an old maid   also a her last ambition The Church ha frequently canonized the woman   in such a case     51 The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before   the saint a the enigma of selfsubjugation and utter voluntary   privationwhy did they thus bow They divined in himand a it were   behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearancethe   superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation the   strength of will in which they recognized their own strength and   love of power and knew how to honour it they honoured something   in themselves when they honoured the saint In addition to this the   contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion such an   enormity of selfnegation and antinaturalness will not have been   coveted for nothingthey have said inquiringly There is perhaps a   reason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic might   wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutor and   visitor In a word the mighty one of the world learned to have a new   fear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconquered   enemyit wa the Will to Power which obliged them to halt before the   saint They had to question him     52 In the Jewish Old Testament the book of divine justice there are   men thing and saying on such an immense scale that Greek and Indian   literature ha nothing to compare with it One stand with fear and   reverence before those stupendous remains of what man wa formerly and   one ha sad thought about old Asia and it little outpushed peninsula   Europe which would like by all mean to figure before Asia a the   Progress of Mankind To be sure he who is himself only a slender   tame houseanimal and know only the want of a houseanimal like   our cultured people of today including the Christians of cultured   Christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruinsthe   taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to great and   small perhaps he will find that the New Testament the book of grace   still appeal more to his heart there is much of the odour of the   genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it To have bound   up this New Testament a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect along   with the Old Testament into one book a the Bible a The Book in   Itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the Spirit   which literary Europe ha upon it conscience     53 Why Atheism nowadays The father in God is thoroughly refuted   equally so the judge the rewarder Also his free will he doe   not hearand even if he did he would not know how to help The worst   is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he   uncertainThis is what I have made out by questioning and listening   at a variety of conversation to be the cause of the decline of   European theism it appears to me that though the religious instinct is   in vigorous growthit reject the theistic satisfaction with profound   distrust     54 What doe all modern philosophy mainly do Since Descartesand   indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedurean   ATTENTAT ha been made on the part of all philosopher on the old   conception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subject   and predicate conceptionthat is to say an ATTENTAT on the   fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine Modern philosophy   a epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly ANTICHRISTIAN   although for keener ear be it said by no mean antireligious   Formerly in effect one believed in the soul a one believed in   grammar and the grammatical subject one said I is the condition   think is the predicate and is conditionedto think is an activity for   which one MUST suppose a subject a cause The attempt wa then made   with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out   of this netto see if the opposite wa not perhaps true think the   condition and I the conditioned I therefore only a synthesis   which ha been MADE by thinking itself KANT really wished to prove   that starting from the subject the subject could not be provednor   the object either the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the   subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange   to himthe thought which once had an immense power on earth a the   Vedanta philosophy     55 There is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many round but   three of these are the most important Once on a time men sacrificed   human being to their God and perhaps just those they loved the   bestto this category belong the firstling sacrifice of all primitive   religion and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the   MithraGrotto on the Island of Capri that most terrible of all Roman   anachronism Then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificed   to their God the strongest instinct they possessed their nature   THIS festal joy shine in the cruel glance of ascetic and   antinatural fanatic Finally what still remained to be sacrificed   Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything   comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmony in   future blessedness and justice Was it not necessary to sacrifice God   himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity   gravity fate nothingness To sacrifice God for nothingnessthis   paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty ha been reserved for the   rising generation we all know something thereof already     56 Whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire ha long   endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it   from the halfChristian halfGerman narrowness and stupidity in which   it ha finally presented itself to this century namely in the form of   Schopenhauers philosophy whoever with an Asiatic and superAsiatic   eye ha actually looked inside and into the most worldrenouncing of   all possible mode of thoughtbeyond good and evil and no longer   like Buddha and Schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of   moralitywhoever ha done this ha perhaps just thereby without   really desiring it opened his eye to behold the opposite ideal the   ideal of the most worldapproving exuberant and vivacious man who ha   not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which wa and   is but wish to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS for all eternity   insatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the whole   piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires   the playand make it necessary because he always requires   himself anewand make himself necessaryWhat And this would not   becirculus vitiosus deus     57 The distance and a it were the space around man grows with the   strength of his intellectual vision and insight his world becomes   profounder new star new enigma and notion are ever coming into   view Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye ha exercised   it acuteness and profundity ha just been an occasion for it exercise   something of a game something for child and childish mind Perhaps   the most solemn conception that have caused the most fighting and   suffering the conception God and sin will one day seem to u of   no more importance than a child plaything or a child pain seems to   an old manand perhaps another plaything and another pain will then   be necessary once more for the old manalways childish enough an   eternal child     58 Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness or   semiidleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for it   favourite microscopic labour of selfexamination and for it soft   placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the   coming of God I mean the idleness with a good conscience the   idleness of olden time and of blood to which the aristocratic   sentiment that work is DISHONOURINGthat it vulgarizes body and   soulis not quite unfamiliar And that consequently the modern noisy   timeengrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates   and prepares for unbelief more than anything else Among these for   instance who are at present living apart from religion in Germany I   find freethinker of diversified specie and origin but above all   a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation   ha dissolved the religious instinct so that they no longer know what   purpose religion serve and only note their existence in the world   with a kind of dull astonishment They feel themselves already fully   occupied these good people be it by their business or by their   pleasure not to mention the Fatherland and the newspaper and   their family duty it seems that they have no time whatever left   for religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is a   question of a new business or a new pleasurefor it is impossible they   say to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoil   their temper They are by no mean enemy of religious custom   should certain circumstance State affair perhaps require their   participation in such custom they do what is required a so many   thing are donewith a patient and unassuming seriousness and without   much curiosity or discomfortthey live too much apart and outside   to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matter Among   those indifferent person may be reckoned nowadays the majority of   German Protestants of the middle class especially in the great   laborious centre of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious   scholar and the entire University personnel with the exception of   the theologian whose existence and possibility there always give   psychologist new and more subtle puzzle to solve On the part of   pious or merely churchgoing people there is seldom any idea of HOW   MUCH goodwill one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for a   German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole   profession and a I have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to   which he is compelled by his modern conscience incline him to a   lofty and almost charitable serenity a regard religion with which is   occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit   which he take for granted wherever any one still professes to belong   to the Church It is only with the help of history NOT through his own   personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing   himself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deference   in presence of religion but even when his sentiment have reached the   stage of gratitude towards them he ha not personally advanced one   step nearer to that which still maintains itself a Church or a piety   perhaps even the contrary The practical indifference to religious   matter in the midst of which he ha been born and brought up usually   sublimate itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which   shuns contact with religious men and thing and it may be just the   depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompt him to avoid the   delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with itEvery age ha   it own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other age   may envy it and how much naiveteadorable childlike and boundlessly   foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in   his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the   unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treat the   religious man a a lower and le valuable type beyond before and   ABOVE which he himself ha developedhe the little arrogant dwarf   and mobman the sedulously alert headandhand drudge of idea of   modern idea     59 Whoever ha seen deeply into the world ha doubtless divined what   wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial It is their   preservative instinct which teach them to be flighty lightsome and   false Here and there one find a passionate and exaggerated adoration   of pure form in philosopher a well a in artist it is not to be   doubted that whoever ha NEED of the cult of the superficial to that   extent ha at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it   Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt   child the born artist who find the enjoyment of life only in trying   to FALSIFY it image a if taking wearisome revenge on it one might   guess to what degree life ha disgusted them by the extent to which   they wish to see it image falsified attenuated ultrified and   deifiedone might reckon the homines religiosi among the artist a   their HIGHEST rank It is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable   pessimism which compels whole century to fasten their teeth into a   religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which   divine that truth might be attained TOO soon before man ha become   strong enough hard enough artist enough Piety the Life in God   regarded in this light would appear a the most elaborate and   ultimate product of the FEAR of truth a artistadoration   and artistintoxication in presence of the most logical of all   falsification a the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at   any price Perhaps there ha hitherto been no more effective mean of   beautifying man than piety by mean of it man can become so artful so   superficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longer   offends     60 To love mankind FOR GODS SAKEthis ha so far been the noblest and   remotest sentiment to which mankind ha attained That love to mankind   without any redeeming intention in the background is only an ADDITIONAL   folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love ha first to   get it proportion it delicacy it gram of salt and sprinkling   of ambergris from a higher inclinationwhoever first perceived   and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered a it   attempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time be   holy and respected a the man who ha so far flown highest and gone   astray in the finest fashion     61 The philosopher a WE free spirit understand himas the man of   the greatest responsibility who ha the conscience for the general   development of mankindwill use religion for his disciplining and   educating work just a he will use the contemporary political   and economic condition The selecting and disciplining   influencedestructive a well a creative and fashioningwhich can be   exercised by mean of religion is manifold and varied according to the   sort of people placed under it spell and protection For those who are   strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the   judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion is   an additional mean for overcoming resistance in the exercise of   authorityas a bond which bind ruler and subject in common   betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter   their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience And in the   case of the unique nature of noble origin if by virtue of superior   spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative   life reserving to themselves only the more refined form of government   over chosen disciple or member of an order religion itself may   be used a a mean for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of   managing GROSSER affair and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE   filth of all political agitation The Brahmins for instance understood   this fact With the help of a religious organization they secured to   themselves the power of nominating king for the people while their   sentiment prompted them to keep apart and outside a men with a higher   and superregal mission At the same time religion give inducement and   opportunity to some of the subject to qualify themselves for future   ruling and commanding the slowly ascending rank and class in which   through fortunate marriage custom volitional power and delight in   selfcontrol are on the increase To them religion offer sufficient   incentive and temptation to aspire to higher intellectuality and to   experience the sentiment of authoritative selfcontrol of silence and   of solitude Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable mean of   educating and ennobling a race which seek to rise above it hereditary   baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy And finally to   ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service and   general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion give   invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heart   ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy   with something of transfiguration and embellishment something of   justification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all   the semianimal poverty of their soul Religion together with the   religious significance of life shed sunshine over such perpetually   harassed men and make even their own aspect endurable to them it   operates upon them a the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon   sufferer of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manner   almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT and in the end even hallowing and   vindicating it There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity   and Buddhism a their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate   themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of thing and thereby   to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it   difficult enough to livethis very difficulty being necessary     62 To be sureto make also the bad counterreckoning against such   religion and to bring to light their secret dangersthe cost is   always excessive and terrible when religion do NOT operate a an   educational and disciplinary medium in the hand of the philosopher but   rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY when they wish to be the final end   and not a mean along with other mean Among men a among all other   animal there is a surplus of defective diseased degenerating   infirm and necessarily suffering individual the successful case   among men also are always the exception and in view of the fact that   man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT the rare   exception But worse still The higher the type a man represents the   greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED the accidental the   law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifest   itself most terribly in it destructive effect on the higher order of   men the condition of whose life are delicate diverse and difficult   to determine What then is the attitude of the two greatest religion   abovementioned to the SURPLUS of failure in life They endeavour   to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved in fact a the   religion FOR SUFFERERS they take the part of these upon principle   they are always in favour of those who suffer from life a from a   disease and they would fain treat every other experience of life a   false and impossible However highly we may esteem this indulgent and   preservative care inasmuch a in applying to others it ha applied   and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of   man the hitherto PARAMOUNT religionsto give a general appreciation   of themare among the principal cause which have kept the type of   man upon a lower levelthey have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD   HAVE PERISHED One ha to thank them for invaluable service and who is   sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation   of all that the spiritual men of Christianity have done for Europe   hitherto But when they had given comfort to the sufferer courage to   the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless   and when they had allured from society into convent and spiritual   penitentiary the brokenhearted and distracted what else had they   to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good   conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which   mean in deed and in truth to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE   EUROPEAN RACE To REVERSE all estimate of valueTHAT is what they   had to do And to shatter the strong to spoil great hope to cast   suspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomous   manly conquering and imperiousall instinct which are natural to the   highest and most successful type of maninto uncertainty distress   of conscience and selfdestruction forsooth to invert all love of the   earthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth and   earthly thingsTHAT is the task the Church imposed on itself and   wa obliged to impose until according to it standard of value   unworldliness unsensuousness and higher man fused into one   sentiment If one could observe the strangely painful equally coarse   and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and   impartial eye of an Epicurean god I should think one would never cease   marvelling and laughing doe it not actually seem that some single will   ha ruled over Europe for eighteen century in order to make a SUBLIME   ABORTION of man He however who with opposite requirement no longer   Epicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach this   almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind a exemplified in   the European Christian Pascal for instance would he not have to   cry aloud with rage pity and horror Oh you bungler presumptuous   pitiful bungler what have you done Was that a work for your hand   How you have hacked and botched my finest stone What have you presumed   to doI should say that Christianity ha hitherto been the most   portentous of presumption Men not great enough nor hard enough   to be

reality they honour and love only themselves or their own ideal to   express it more agreeably Thus man wish woman to be peaceable but   in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable like the cat however

diverse sensitive and refined a the Science of Morals   belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarsefingeredan   interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious   in the very person of a moralist Indeed the expression Science   of Morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too   presumptuous and counter to GOOD tastewhich is always a foretaste of   more modest expression One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT   is still necessary here for a long time WHAT is alone proper for the   present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey   and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiment of worth   and distinction of worth which live grow propagate and perishand   perhaps attempt to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common   form of these living crystallizationsas preparation for a THEORY OF   TYPES of morality To be sure people have not hitherto been so modest   All the philosopher with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness   demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and   ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality a a science   they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to moralityand every philosopher hitherto   ha believed that he ha given it a basis morality itself however ha   been regarded a something given How far from their awkward pride   wa the seemingly insignificant problemleft in dust and decayof a   description of form of morality notwithstanding that the finest hand   and sens could hardly be fine enough for it It wa precisely owing to   moral philosopher knowing the moral fact imperfectly in an arbitrary   epitome or an accidental abridgementperhaps a the morality of   their environment their position their church their Zeitgeist their   climate and zoneit wa precisely because they were badly instructed   with regard to nation era and past age and were by no mean eager   to know about these matter that they did not even come in sight of the   real problem of moralsproblems which only disclose themselves by   a comparison of MANY kind of morality In every Science of Morals   hitherto strange a it may sound the problem of morality itself   ha been OMITTED there ha been no suspicion that there wa anything   problematic there That which philosopher called giving a basis to   morality and endeavoured to realize ha when seen in a right light   proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality a new   mean of it EXPRESSION consequently just a matteroffact within the   sphere of a definite morality yea in it ultimate motive a sort of   denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in questionand   in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and   vivisecting of this very faith Hear for instance with what   innocencealmost worthy of honourSchopenhauer represents his own   task and draw your conclusion concerning the scientificness of a   Science whose latest master still talk in the strain of child and   old wife The principle he say page 136 of the Grundprobleme der   Ethik Footnote Pages 5455 of Schopenhauers Basis of Morality   translated by Arthur B Bullock MA 1903 the axiom about the   purport of which all moralist are PRACTICALLY agreed neminem laede   immo omnes quantum potes juvais REALLY the proposition which all moral   teacher strive to establish   the REAL basis of ethic which   ha been sought like the philosopher stone for centuriesThe   difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be   greatit is well known that Schopenhauer also wa unsuccessful in his   effort and whoever ha thoroughly realized how absurdly false and   sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is Will   to Power may be reminded that Schopenhauer although a pessimist   ACTUALLYplayed the flute daily after dinner one may read about   the matter in his biography A question by the way a pessimist a   repudiator of God and of the world who MAKES A HALT at moralitywho   assent to morality and play the flute to laedeneminem moral what   Is that reallya pessimist     187 Apart from the value of such assertion a there is a categorical   imperative in u one can always ask What doe such an assertion   indicate about him who make it There are system of moral which are   meant to justify their author in the eye of other people other system   of moral are meant to tranquilize him and make him selfsatisfied   with other system he want to crucify and humble himself with others   he wish to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others   to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinctionthis system of   moral help it author to forget that system make him or something   of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and   creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps Kant   especially give u to understand by his moral that what is estimable   in me is that I know how to obeyand with you it SHALL not be   otherwise than with me In short system of moral are only a   SIGNLANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS     188 In contrast to laisseraller every system of moral is a sort of   tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no   objection unless one should again decree by some system of moral that   all kind of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is   essential and invaluable in every system of moral is that it is a   long constraint In order to understand Stoicism or Port Royal   or Puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every   language ha attained to strength and freedomthe metrical constraint   the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm How much trouble have the poet and   orator of every nation given themselvesnot excepting some of   the prose writer of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable   conscientiousnessfor the sake of a folly a utilitarian bungler   say and thereby deem themselves wisefrom submission to arbitrary   law a the anarchist say and thereby fancy themselves free even   freespirited The singular fact remains however that everything   of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly   certainty which exists or ha existed whether it be in thought itself   or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just a in   conduct ha only developed by mean of the tyranny of such arbitrary   law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely   this is nature and naturaland not laisseraller Every artist   know how different from the state of letting himself go is his   most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing   and constructing in the moment of inspirationand how strictly and   delicately he then obeys a thousand law which by their very rigidness   and precision defy all formulation by mean of idea even the most   stable idea ha in comparison therewith something floating manifold   and ambiguous in it The essential thing in heaven and in earth is   apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long OBEDIENCE   in the same direction there thereby result and ha always resulted in   the long run something which ha made life worth living for instance   virtue art music dancing reason spiritualityanything whatever   that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine The long bondage of   the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of   idea the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think   in accordance with the rule of a church or a court or conformable   to Aristotelian premise the persistent spiritual will to interpret   everything that happened according to a Christian scheme and in every   occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian Godall this   violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness   ha proved itself the disciplinary mean whereby the European spirit ha   attained it strength it remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility   granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be   stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here a everywhere   nature show herself a she is in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT   magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble That   for century European thinker only thought in order to prove   somethingnowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker   who wish to prove somethingthat it wa always settled beforehand   what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking a it wa perhaps   in the Asiatic astrology of former time or a it is still at the   present day in the innocent Christianmoral explanation of immediate   personal event for the glory of God or for the good of the   soulthis tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent   stupidity ha EDUCATED the spirit slavery both in the coarser and   the finer sense is apparently an indispensable mean even of spiritual   education and discipline One may look at every system of moral in this   light it is nature therein which teach to hate the laisseraller   the too great freedom and implant the need for limited horizon for   immediate dutiesit teach the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES and thus in   a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development   Thou must obey some one and for a long time OTHERWISE thou wilt come   to grief and lose all respect for thyselfthis seems to me to be the   moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical   a old Kant wished consequently the otherwise nor doe it address   itself to the individual what doe nature care for the individual   but to nation race age and rank above all however to the   animal man generally to MANKIND     189 Industrious race find it a great hardship to be idle it wa a   master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such   an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his weekand   workday againas a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated   FAST such a is also frequently found in the ancient world although   a is appropriate in southern nation not precisely with respect   to work Many kind of fast are necessary and wherever powerful   influence and habit prevail legislator have to see that intercalary   day are appointed on which such impulse are fettered and learn to   hunger anew Viewed from a higher standpoint whole generation and   epoch when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism   seem like those intercalated period of restraint and fasting during   which an impulse learns to humble and submit itselfat the same time   also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself certain philosophical sect likewise   admit of a similar interpretation for instance the Stoa in the midst   of Hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with   Aphrodisiacal odoursHere also is a hint for the explanation of the   paradox why it wa precisely in the most Christian period of European   history and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiment   that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amourpassion     190 There is something in the morality of Plato which doe not really   belong to Plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might   say in spite of him namely Socratism for which he himself wa   too noble No one desire to injure himself hence all evil is done   unwittingly The evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do   so however if he knew that evil is evil The evil man therefore is   only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily   make himgoodThis mode of reasoning savour of the POPULACE who   perceive only the unpleasant consequence of evildoing and practically   judge that it is STUPID to do wrong while they accept good a   identical with useful and pleasant without further thought As   regard every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it   ha the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom errPlato   did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the   tenet of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into themhe   the most daring of all interpreter who lifted the entire Socrates out   of the street a a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless   and impossible modificationsnamely in all his own disguise and   multiplicity In jest and in Homeric language a well what is the   Platonic Socrates if notGreek word inserted here     191 The old theological problem of Faith and Knowledge or more   plainly of instinct and reasonthe question whether in respect to the   valuation of thing instinct deserves more authority than rationality   which want to appreciate and act according to motif according to   a Why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utilityit   is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of   Socrates and had divided men mind long before Christianity Socrates   himself following of course the taste of his talentthat of a   surpassing dialecticiantook first the side of reason and in fact   what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the   noble Athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could   never give satisfactory answer concerning the motif of their action   In the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also   at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found   in himself the same difficulty and incapacity But whyhe said   to himselfshould one on that account separate oneself from the   instinct One must set them right and the reason ALSOone must follow   the instinct but at the same time persuade the reason to support them   with good argument This wa the real FALSENESS of that great and   mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he   wa satisfied with a kind of selfoutwitting in fact he perceived   the irrationality in the moral judgmentPlato more innocent in such   matter and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to   himself at the expenditure of all his strengththe greatest strength   a philosopher had ever expendedthat reason and instinct lead   spontaneously to one goal to the good to God and since Plato all   theologian and philosopher have followed the same pathwhich mean   that in matter of morality instinct or a Christians call it   Faith or a I call it the herd ha hitherto triumphed Unless   one should make an exception in the case of Descartes the father of   rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution who   recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and   Descartes wa superficial     192 Whoever ha followed the history of a single science find in   it development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest   process of all knowledge and cognizance there a here the   premature hypothesis the fiction the good stupid will to belief   and the lack of distrust and patience are first developedour sens   learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and   cautious organ of knowledge Our eye find it easier on a given   occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon   the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more   force more morality It is difficult and painful for the ear to   listen to anything new we hear strange music badly When we hear   another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sound   into word with which we are more familiar and conversantit wa thus   for example that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into   ARMBRUST crossbow Our sens are also hostile and averse to the   new and generally even in the simplest process of sensation the   emotion DOMINATEsuch a fear love hatred and the passive emotion   of indolenceAs little a a reader nowadays read all the single word   not to speak of syllable of a pagehe rather take about five out   of every twenty word at random and guess the probably appropriate   sense to themjust a little do we see a tree correctly and completely   in respect to it leaf branch colour and shape we find it so   much easier to fancy the chance of a tree Even in the midst of the   most remarkable experience we still do just the same we fabricate the   greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate   any event EXCEPT a inventor thereof All this go to prove   that from our fundamental nature and from remote age we have   beenACCUSTOMED TO LYING Or to express it more politely and   hypocritically in short more pleasantlyone is much more of an artist   than one is aware ofIn an animated conversation I often see the face   of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined   before me according to the thought he express or which I believe to   be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the   STRENGTH of my visual facultythe delicacy of the play of the muscle   and of the expression of the eye MUST therefore be imagined by me   Probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all     193 Quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise What we   experience in dream provided we experience it often pertains at   last just a much to the general belonging of our soul a anything   actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we   have a requirement more or le and finally in broad daylight and   even in the brightest moment of our waking life we are ruled to some   extent by the nature of our dream Supposing that someone ha often   flown in his dream and that at last a soon a he dream he is   conscious of the power and art of flying a his privilege and his   peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who belief that on the   slightest impulse he can actualize all sort of curve and angle who   know the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards   without effort or constraint a downwards without descending   or loweringwithout TROUBLEhow could the man with such   dreamexperiences and dreamhabits fail to find happiness differently   coloured and defined even in his waking hour How could he failto   long DIFFERENTLY for happiness Flight such a is described by poet   must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular   violent far too troublesome for him     194 The difference among men doe not manifest itself only in the   difference of their list of desirable thingsin their regarding   different good thing a worth striving for and being disagreed a to   the greater or le value the order of rank of the commonly recognized   desirable thingsit manifest itself much more in what they regard a   actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing As regard a woman   for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification   serf a an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the   more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for   possession see the questionableness the mere apparentness of such   ownership and wish to have finer test in order to know especially   whether the woman not only give herself to him but also give up for   his sake what she ha or would like to haveonly THEN doe he look upon   her a possessed A third however ha not even here got to the limit   of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether   the woman when she give up everything for him doe not perhaps do   so for a phantom of him he wish first to be thoroughly indeed   profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he venture to let   himself be found out Only then doe he feel the beloved one fully in   his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when   she love him just a much for the sake of his devilry and concealed   insatiability a for his goodness patience and spirituality One   man would like to posse a nation and he find all the higher art of   Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose Another with a more   refined thirst for possession say to himself One may not deceive   where one desire to possesshe is irritated and impatient at the idea   that a mask of him should rule in the heart of the people I must   therefore MAKE myself known and first of all learn to know myself   Among helpful and charitable people one almost always find the awkward   craftiness which first get up suitably him who ha to be helped a   though for instance he should merit help seek just THEIR help and   would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them   for all help With these conceit they take control of the needy a a   property just a in general they are charitable and helpful out of a   desire for property One find them jealous when they are crossed or   forestalled in their charity Parents involuntarily make something like   themselves out of their childrenthey call that education no mother   doubt at the bottom of her heart that the child she ha borne is   thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN   idea and notion of worth Indeed in former time father deemed it   right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly   born a among the ancient Germans And like the father so also do the   teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new   individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession The   consequence is     195 The Jewsa people born for slavery a Tacitus and the whole   ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nation a   they themselves say and believethe Jews performed the miracle of the   inversion of valuation by mean of which life on earth obtained a new   and dangerous charm for a couple of millennium Their prophet fused   into one the expression rich godless wicked violent   sensual and for the first time coined the word world a a term of   reproach In this inversion of valuation in which is also included   the use of the word poor a synonymous with saint and friend the   significance of the Jewish people is to be found it is with THEM that   the SLAVEINSURRECTION IN MORALS commences     196 It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark body near the   sunsuch a we shall never see Among ourselves this is an allegory   and the psychologist of moral read the whole starwriting merely a an   allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed     197 The beast of prey and the man of prey for instance Caesar Borgia   are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long a   one seek a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of   all tropical monster and growth or even an innate hell in themas   almost all moralist have done hitherto Does it not seem that there is   a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropic among moralist And   that the tropical man must be discredited at all cost whether   a disease and deterioration of mankind or a his own hell and   selftorture And why In favour of the temperate zone In favour   of the temperate men The moral The mediocreThis for the chapter   Morals a Timidity     198 All the system of moral which address themselves with a view to   their happiness a it is calledwhat else are they but suggestion   for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which   the individual live recipe for their passion their good and bad   propensity insofar a such have the Will to Power and would like   to play the master small and great expediency and elaboration   permeated with the musty odour of old family medicine and oldwife   wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their formbecause   they address themselves to all because they generalize where   generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally   and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely   with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even   seductive when they are overspiced and begin to smell dangerously   especially of the other world That is all of little value when   estimated intellectually and is far from being science much le   wisdom but repeated once more and three time repeated it is   expediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupidity   stupiditywhether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness   towards the heated folly of the emotion which the Stoics advised and   fostered or the nomorelaughing and nomoreweeping of Spinoza the   destruction of the emotion by their analysis and vivisection which he   recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotion to an innocent   mean at which they may be satisfied the Aristotelianism of moral   or even morality a the enjoyment of the emotion in a voluntary   attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps a   music or a love of God and of mankind for Gods sakefor in religion   the passion are once more enfranchised provided that or finally   even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotion a ha   been taught by Hafis and Goethe the bold lettinggo of the rein the   spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional case of   wise old codger and drunkard with whom it no longer ha much   dangerThis also for the chapter Morals a Timidity     199 Inasmuch a in all age a long a mankind ha existed there have   also been human herd family alliance community tribe people   state church and always a great number who obey in proportion   to the small number who commandin view therefore of the fact that   obedience ha been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto   one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is   now innate in every one a a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which give   the command Thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally   refrain from something in short Thou shalt This need try to   satisfy itself and to fill it form with a content according to it   strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes a an omnivorous   appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into   it ear by all sort of commandersparents teacher law class   prejudice or public opinion The extraordinary limitation of human   development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and   turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herdinstinct of   obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command If   one imagine this instinct increasing to it greatest extent commander   and independent individual will finally be lacking altogether or they   will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose   a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to   command just a if they also were only obeying This condition of thing   actually exists in Europe at presentI call it the moral hypocrisy of   the commanding class They know no other way of protecting themselves   from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executor of older   and higher order of predecessor of the constitution of justice of   the law or of God himself or they even justify themselves by maxim   from the current opinion of the herd a first servant of their   people or instrument of the public weal On the other hand the   gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air a if he were the only   kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his quality such a   public spirit kindness deference industry temperance modesty   indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and   useful to the herd a the peculiarly human virtue In case however   where it is believed that the leader and bellwether can not be dispensed   with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commander   by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative   constitution for example are of this origin In spite of all what a   blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the   appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeansof this   fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon wa the last great proof   the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of   the higher happiness to which the entire century ha attained in it   worthiest individual and period     200 The man of an age of dissolution which mix the race with   one another who ha the inheritance of a diversified descent in his   bodythat is to say contrary and often not only contrary instinct   and standard of value which struggle with one another and are seldom   at peacesuch a man of late culture and broken light will on an   average be a weak man His fundamental desire is that the war which is   IN HIM should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character   of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance Epicurean   or Christian it is above all thing the happiness of repose of   undisturbedness of repletion of final unityit is the Sabbath of   Sabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician St Augustine   who wa himself such a manShould however the contrariety and   conflict in such nature operate a an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus   to lifeand if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and   irreconcilable instinct they have also inherited and indoctrinated   into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict   with themselves that is to say the faculty of selfcontrol and   selfdeception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and   inexplicable being those enigmatical men predestined for conquering   and circumventing others the finest example of which are Alcibiades   and Caesar with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans   according to my taste the Hohenstaufen Frederick the Second and   among artist perhaps Leonardo da Vinci They appear precisely in the   same period when that weaker type with it longing for repose come   to the front the two type are complementary to each other and spring   from the same cause     201 As long a the utility which determines moral estimate is only   gregarious utility a long a the preservation of the community is only   kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in   what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be   no morality of love to one neighbour Granted even that there is   already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness   gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition   of society all those instinct are already active which are latterly   distinguished by honourable name a virtue and eventually almost   coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not   a yet belong to the domain of moral valuationsthey are still   ULTRAMORAL A sympathetic action for instance is neither called good   nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the Romans and should   it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this   praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared   with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the RES   PUBLICA After all love to our neighbour is always a secondary   matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to   our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR After the fabric of society seems on the   whole established and secured against external danger it is this   fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspective of moral   valuation Certain strong and dangerous instinct such a the love of   enterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and   love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the   point of view of general utilityunder other name of course than   those here givenbut had to be fostered and cultivated because they   were perpetually required in the common danger against the common   enemy are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strongwhen   the outlet for them are lackingand are gradually branded a immoral   and given over to calumny The contrary instinct and inclination now   attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draw it   conclusion How much or how little dangerousness to the community or   to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a   disposition or an endowmentthat is now the moral perspective here   again fear is the mother of moral It is by the loftiest and strongest   instinct when they break out passionately and carry the individual   far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious   conscience that the selfreliance of the community is destroyed it   belief in itself it backbone a it were break consequently these   very instinct will be most branded and defamed The lofty independent   spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are   felt to be danger everything that elevates the individual above the   herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called   EVIL the tolerant unassuming selfadapting selfequalizing   disposition the MEDIOCRITY of desire attains to moral distinction and   honour Finally under very peaceful circumstance there is always   le opportunity and necessity for training the feeling to severity   and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begin   to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and   selfresponsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb   and still more the sheep win respect There is a point of diseased   mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society   itself take the part of him who injures it the part of the CRIMINAL   and doe so in fact seriously and honestly To punish appears to it   to be somehow unfairit is certain that the idea of punishment and   the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people Is   it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS Why should we   still punish Punishment itself is terriblewith these question   gregarious morality the morality of fear draw it ultimate   conclusion If one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear   one would have done away with this morality at the same time it   would no longer be necessary it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer   necessaryWhoever examines the conscience of the presentday European   will always elicit the same imperative from it thousand moral fold   and hidden recess the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish   that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR Some time   or otherthe will and the way THERETO is nowadays called progress all   over Europe     202 Let u at once say again what we have already said a hundred   time for people ear nowadays are unwilling to hear such truthsOUR   truth We know well enough how offensive it sound when any one   plainly and without metaphor count man among the animal but it will   be accounted to u almost a CRIME that it is precisely in respect to   men of modern idea that we have constantly applied the term herd   herdinstincts and such like expression What avail is it We can not   do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is We   have found that in all the principal moral judgment Europe ha become   unanimous including likewise the country where European influence   prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he   did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to   teachthey know today what is good and evil It must then sound hard   and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which   here think it know that which here glorifies itself with praise   and blame and call itself good is the instinct of the herding human   animal the instinct which ha come and is ever coming more and more   to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instinct   according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance   of which it is the symptom MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS   HERDINGANIMAL MORALITY and therefore a we understand the matter   only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after   which many other morality and above all HIGHER morality are or   should be possible Against such a possibility against such a should   be however this morality defends itself with all it strength it   say obstinately and inexorably I am morality itself and nothing else   is morality Indeed with the help of a religion which ha humoured   and flattered the sublimest desire of the herdinganimal thing have   reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of   this morality even in political and social arrangement the DEMOCRATIC   movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement That it TEMPO   however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient one for   those who are sick and distracted by the herdinginstinct is indicated   by the increasingly furious howling and always le disguised   teethgnashing of the anarchist dog who are now roving through the   highway of European culture Apparently in opposition to the peacefully   industrious democrat and Revolutionideologues and still more so   to the awkward philosophasters and fraternityvisionaries who call   themselves Socialists and want a free society those are really at one   with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form   of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd to the extent even of   repudiating the notion master and servantni dieu ni maitre say   a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every   special claim every special right and privilege this mean ultimately   opposition to EVERY right for when all are equal no one need right   any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice a though it   were a violation of the weak unfair to the NECESSARY consequence of   all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy   in their compassion for all that feel life and suffers down to the   very animal up even to Godthe extravagance of sympathy for   God belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and   impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering   generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or   ALLOWING it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heartsoftening   under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new   Buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy a   though it were morality in itself the climax the ATTAINED climax of   mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present   the great discharge from all the obligation of the past altogether at   one in their belief in the community a the DELIVERER in the herd and   therefore in themselves     203 We who hold a different beliefwe who regard the democratic   movement not only a a degenerating form of political organization but   a equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man a involving his   mediocrising and depreciation where have WE to fix our hope In   NEW PHILOSOPHERSthere is no other alternative in mind strong and   original enough to initiate opposite estimate of value to transvalue   and invert eternal valuation in forerunner in men of the future   who in the present shall fix the constraint and fasten the knot which   will compel millennium to take NEW path To teach man the future   of humanity a his WILL a depending on human will and to make   preparation for vast hazardous enterprise and collective attempt in   rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful   rule of folly and chance which ha hitherto gone by the name of   history the folly of the greatest number is only it last   formfor that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will   some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that   ha existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent being might   look pale and dwarfed The image of such leader hovers before OUR   eyesis it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirit The   condition which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for   their genesis the presumptive method and test by virtue of which   a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power a to feel a   CONSTRAINT to these task a transvaluation of value under the new   pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart   transformed into brass so a to bear the weight of such responsibility   and on the other hand the necessity for such leader the dreadful   danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degeneratethese   are OUR real anxiety and gloom ye know it well ye free spirit   these are the heavy distant thought and storm which sweep across the   heaven of OUR life There are few pain so grievous a to have seen   divined or experienced how an exceptional man ha missed his way and   deteriorated but he who ha the rare eye for the universal danger   of man himself DETERIORATING he who like u ha recognized the   extraordinary fortuitousness which ha hitherto played it game in   respect to the future of mankinda game in which neither the hand nor   even a finger of God ha participatedhe who divine the fate that   is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of   modern idea and still more under the whole of ChristoEuropean   moralitysuffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared   He see at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through   a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human power and   arrangement he know with all the knowledge of his conviction how   unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibility and how often   in the past the type man ha stood in presence of mysterious decision   and new pathshe know still better from his painfulest recollection   on what wretched obstacle promising development of the highest rank   have hitherto usually gone to piece broken down sunk and become   contemptible The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of   the man of the futureas idealized by the socialistic fool and   shallowpatesthis degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely   gregarious animal or a they call it to a man of free society   this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal right and claim is   undoubtedly POSSIBLE He who ha thought out this possibility to it   ultimate conclusion know ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of   mankindand perhaps also a new MISSION         CHAPTER VI WE SCHOLARS       204 At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here a that   which it ha always beennamely resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES   according to BalzacI would venture to protest against an improper and   injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and a if with the   best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relation   of science and philosophy I mean to say that one must have the right   out of one own EXPERIENCEexperience a it seems to me always   implies unfortunate experienceto treat of such an important question   of rank so a not to speak of colour like the blind or AGAINST science   like woman and artist Ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct   and their shame it always FINDS THINGS OUT The declaration of   independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy   is one of the subtler aftereffect of democratic organization and   disorganization the selfglorification and selfconceitedness of   the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in it best   springtimewhich doe not mean to imply that in this case selfpraise   smell sweet Here also the instinct of the populace cry Freedom   from all master and after science ha with the happiest result   resisted theology whose handmaid it had been too long it now   proposes in it wantonness and indiscretion to lay down law for   philosophy and in it turn to play the masterwhat am I saying   to play the PHILOSOPHER on it own account My memorythe memory of   a scientific man if you pleaseteems with the naivete of insolence   which I have heard about philosophy and philosopher from young   naturalist and old physician not to mention the most cultured and   most conceited of all learned men the philologist and schoolmaster   who are both the one and the other by profession On one occasion it   wa the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the   defensive against all synthetic task and capability at another time   it wa the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined   luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt   himself aggrieved and belittled thereby On another occasion it wa the   colourblindness of the utilitarian who see nothing in philosophy but   a series of REFUTED system and an extravagant expenditure which doe   nobody any good At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of   the boundaryadjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another   time the disregard of individual philosopher which had involuntarily   extended to disregard of philosophy generally In fine I found most   frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholar   the evil aftereffect of some particular philosopher to whom on the   whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his   scornful estimate of other philosopher having been got rid ofthe   result being a general illwill to all philosophy Such seems to   me for instance the aftereffect of Schopenhauer on the most modern   Germany by his unintelligent rage against Hegel he ha succeeded in   severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from it connection   with German culture which culture all thing considered ha been   an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE but   precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself wa poor irreceptive   and unGerman to the extent of ingeniousness On the whole speaking   generally it may just have been the humanness alltoohumanness of the   modern philosopher themselves in short their contemptibleness which   ha injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the   door to the instinct of the populace Let it but be acknowledged to   what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the   world of Heraclitus Plato Empedocles and whatever else all the royal   and magnificent anchorite of the spirit were called and with what   justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and   origin in view of such representative of philosophy who owing to   the fashion of the present day are just a much aloft a they are down   belowin Germany for instance the two lion of Berlin the anarchist   Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann It is especially   the sight of those hotchpotch philosopher who call themselves   realist or positivist which is calculated to implant a   dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those   philosopher at the best are themselves but scholar and specialist   that is very evident All of them are person who have been vanquished   and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science who at one time   or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the   more and it responsibilityand who now creditably rancorously and   vindictively represent in word and deed DISBELIEF in the mastertask   and supremacy of philosophy After all how could it be otherwise   Science flourish nowadays and ha the good conscience clearly visible   on it countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy ha   gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites   distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to   a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of   epoch and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even   get beyond the threshold and rigorously DENIES itself the right   to enterthat is philosophy in it last throe an end an agony   something that awakens pity How could such a philosophyRULE     205 The danger that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in   fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit   could still come to maturity The extent and towering structure of the   science have increased enormously and therewith also the probability   that the philosopher will grow tired even a a learner or will attach   himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to   his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection   and his DESPECTION Or he get aloft too late when the best of his   maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and   deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of thing is no   longer of much importance It is perhaps just the refinement of his   intellectual conscience that make him hesitate and linger on the   way he dread the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede a   milleantenna he know too well that a a discerner one who ha lost   his selfrespect no longer command no longer LEADS unless he should   aspire to become a great playactor a philosophical Cagliostro and   spiritual ratcatcherin short a misleader This is in the last   instance a question of taste if it ha not really been a question of   conscience To double once more the philosopher difficulty there is   also the fact that he demand from himself a verdict a Yea or Nay not   concerning science but concerning life and the worth of lifehe learns   unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain   this verdict and he ha to seek his way to the right and the belief   only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying   experience often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded In fact the   philosopher ha long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either   with the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiously   elevated desensualized desecularized visionary and Godintoxicated   man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he life   wisely or a a philosopher it hardly mean anything more than   prudently and apart Wisdom that seems to the populace to be a kind   of flight a mean and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a   bad game but the GENUINE philosopherdoes it not seem so to US   my friendslives unphilosophically and unwisely above all   IMPRUDENTLY and feel the obligation and burden of a hundred attempt   and temptation of lifehe risk HIMSELF constantly he play THIS bad   game     206 In relation to the genius that is to say a being who either   ENGENDERS or PRODUCESboth word understood in their fullest sensethe   man of learning the scientific average man ha always something of   the old maid about him for like her he is not conversant with the two   principal function of man To both of course to the scholar and   to the old maid one concedes respectability a if by way of   indemnificationin these case one emphasizes the respectabilityand   yet in the compulsion of this concession one ha the same admixture   of vexation Let u examine more closely what is the scientific man   Firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtue that is   to say a nonruling nonauthoritative and nonselfsufficient type   of man he posse industry patient adaptableness to rank and file   equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he ha the   instinct for people like himself and for that which they requirefor   instance the portion of independence and green meadow without which   there is no rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration   which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability   the sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value and   usefulness with which the inward DISTRUST which lie at the bottom of   the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animal ha again and   again to be overcome The learned man a is appropriate ha also   malady and fault of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and   ha a lynxeye for the weak point in those nature to whose elevation   he can not attain He is confiding yet only a one who let himself go   but doe not FLOW and precisely before the man of the great current he   stand all the colder and more reservedhis eye is then like a smooth   and irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy   The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable result   from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the Jesuitism of   mediocrity which labour instinctively for the destruction of   the exceptional man and endeavour to breakor still better to   relaxevery bent bow To relax of course with consideration and   naturally with an indulgent handto RELAX with confiding sympathy   that is the real art of Jesuitism which ha always understood how to   introduce itself a the religion of sympathy     207 However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spiritand   who ha not been sick to death of all subjectivity and it confounded   IPSISIMOSITYin the end however one must learn caution even with   regard to one gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with   which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit ha recently been   celebrated a if it were the goal in itself a if it were salvation   and glorificationas is especially accustomed to happen in the   pessimist school which ha also in it turn good reason for paying the   highest honour to disinterested knowledge The objective man who no   longer curse and scold like the pessimist the IDEAL man of learning   in whom the scientific instinct blossom forth fully after a thousand   complete and partial failure is assuredly one of the most costly   instrument that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more   powerful He is only an instrument we may say he is a MIRRORhe is no   purpose in himself The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed   to prostration before everything that want to be known with such   desire only a knowing or reflecting implieshe wait until   something come and then expands himself sensitively so that even the   light footstep and glidingpast of spiritual being may not be lost on   his surface and film Whatever personality he still posse seems to   him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much ha he   come to regard himself a the passage and reflection of outside form   and event He call up the recollection of himself with an effort   and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other   person he make mistake with regard to his own need and here only   is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health   or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack   of companion and societyindeed he set himself to reflect on his   suffering but in vain His thought already rove away to the MORE   GENERAL case and tomorrow he know a little a he knew yesterday how   to help himself He doe not now take himself seriously and devote time   to himself he is serene NOT from lack of trouble but from lack   of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual   complaisance with respect to all object and experience the radiant   and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that   come his way his habit of inconsiderate goodnature of dangerous   indifference a to Yea and Nay ala there are enough of case in which   he ha to atone for these virtue of hisand a man generally he   becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtue Should one   wish love or hatred from himI mean love and hatred a God woman and   animal understand themhe will do what he can and furnish what he can   But one must not be surprised if it should not be muchif he should   show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and   deteriorated His love is constrained his hatred is artificial and   rather UN TOUR DE FORCE a slight ostentation and exaggeration He is   only genuine so far a he can be objective only in his serene totality   is he still nature and natural His mirroring and eternally   selfpolishing soul no longer know how to affirm no longer how to   deny he doe not command neither doe he destroy JE NE MEPRISE   PRESQUE RIENhe say with Leibniz let u not overlook nor undervalue   the PRESQUE Neither is he a model man he doe not go in advance of any   one nor after either he place himself generally too far off to have   any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil If he ha   been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER with the Caesarian trainer   and dictator of civilization he ha had far too much honour and what   is more essential in him ha been overlookedhe is an instrument   something of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but   nothing in himselfPRESQUE RIEN The objective man is an instrument   a costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and   mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he   is no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom the   REST of existence justifies itself no terminationand still le a   commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful   selfcentred that want to be master but rather only a soft inflated   delicate movable pottersform that must wait for some kind of content   and frame to shape itself theretofor the most part a man without   frame and content a selfless man Consequently also nothing for   woman IN PARENTHESI     208 When a philosopher nowadays make known that he is not a skepticI   hope that ha been gathered from the foregoing description of the   objective spiritpeople all hear it impatiently they regard him on   that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many   many question indeed among timid hearer of whom there are now so   many he is henceforth said to be dangerous With his repudiation of   skepticism it seems to them a if they heard some evilthreatening   sound in the distance a if a new kind of explosive were being tried   somewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered Russian   NIHILINE a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS that not only denies mean   denial butdreadful thought PRACTISES denial Against this kind of   goodwilla will to the veritable actual negation of lifethere is   a is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedative   than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism   and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctor of the day a an   antidote to the spirit and it underground noise Are not our ear   already full of bad sound say the skeptic a lover of repose and   almost a a kind of safety police this subterranean Nay is terrible   Be still ye pessimistic mole The skeptic in effect that delicate   creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so   a to start at every Nay and even at that sharp decided Yea and feel   something like a bite thereby Yea and Naythey seem to him opposed   to morality he love on the contrary to make a festival to his virtue   by a noble aloofness while perhaps he say with Montaigne What do I   know Or with Socrates I know that I know nothing Or Here I do   not trust myself no door is open to me Or Even if the door were   open why should I enter immediately Or What is the use of any hasty   hypothesis It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypothesis   at all Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is   crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum Is there not time   enough for that Has not the time leisure Oh ye demon can ye not   at all WAIT The uncertain also ha it charm the Sphinx too is a   Circe and Circe too wa a philosopherThus doe a skeptic console   himself and in truth he need some consolation For skepticism is   the most spiritual expression of a certain manysided physiological   temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and   sickliness it arises whenever race or class which have been long   separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another In the new   generation which ha inherited a it were different standard and   valuation in it blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt and   tentativeness the best power operate restrictively the very virtue   prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast   and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul That however   which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescript is the   WILL they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or   the courageous feeling of pleasure in willingthey are doubtful of the   freedom of the will even in their dream Our presentday Europe   the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of   class and CONSEQUENTLY of race is therefore skeptical in all it   height and depth sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which   spring impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with   gloomy aspect like a cloud overcharged with interrogative signsand   often sick unto death of it will Paralysis of will where do we not   find this cripple sitting nowadays And yet how bedecked oftentimes How   seductively ornamented There are the finest gala dress and disguise   for this disease and that for instance most of what place itself   nowadays in the showcase a objectiveness the scientific spirit   LART POUR LART and pure voluntary knowledge is only deckedout   skepticism and paralysis of willI am ready to answer for this   diagnosis of the European diseaseThe disease of the will is diffused   unequally over Europe it is worst and most varied where civilization   ha longest prevailed it decrease according a the barbarian   stillor againasserts his claim under the loose drapery of Western   culture It is therefore in the France of today a can be readily   disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and France   which ha always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the   portentous crisis of it spirit into something charming and seductive   now manifest emphatically it intellectual ascendancy over Europe   by being the school and exhibition of all the charm of skepticism The   power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already   somewhat stronger in Germany and again in the North of Germany it   is stronger than in Central Germany it is considerably stronger in   England Spain and Corsica associated with phlegm in the former and   with hard skull in the latternot to mention Italy which is too young   yet to know what it want and must first show whether it can exercise   will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense   middle empire where Europe a it were flow back to Asianamely in   Russia There the power to will ha been long stored up and accumulated   there the willuncertain whether to be negative or affirmativewaits   threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our   physicist Perhaps not only Indian war and complication in Asia would   be necessary to free Europe from it greatest danger but also internal   subversion the shattering of the empire into small state and above   all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the   obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not   say this a one who desire it in my heart I should rather prefer the   contraryI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of   Russia that Europe would have to make up it mind to become equally   threateningnamely TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL by mean of a new caste to   rule over the Continent a persistent dreadful will of it own that   can set it aim thousand of year ahead so that the long spunout   comedy of it pettystatism and it dynastic a well a it democratic   manywilledness might finally be brought to a close The time for   petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle for the   dominion of the worldthe COMPULSION to great politics     209 As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have   evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger   kind of skepticism I should like to express myself preliminarily   merely by a parable which the lover of German history will already   understand That unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadier   who a King of Prussia brought into being a military and skeptical   geniusand therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emerged   type of German the problematic crazy father of Frederick the Great   had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew   what wa then lacking in Germany the want of which wa a hundred time   more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social formhis   illwill to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound   instinct MEN WERE LACKING and he suspected to his bitterest regret   that his own son wa not man enough There however he deceived   himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place He saw   his son lapsed to atheism to the ESPRIT to the pleasant frivolity of   clever Frenchmenhe saw in the background the great bloodsucker the   spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no   longer hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that no   longer command is no longer ABLE to command Meanwhile however   there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous   skepticismwho know TO WHAT EXTENT it wa encouraged just by   his father hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to   solitudethe skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related   to the genius for war and conquest and made it first entrance into   Germany in the person of the great Frederick This skepticism despises   and nevertheless grasp it undermines and take possession it doe   not believe but it doe not thereby lose itself it give the spirit a   dangerous liberty but it keep strict guard over the heart It is the   GERMAN form of skepticism which a a continued Fredericianism risen   to the highest spirituality ha kept Europe for a considerable time   under the dominion of the German spirit and it critical and historical   distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character   of the great German philologist and historical critic who   rightly estimated were also all of them artist of destruction   and dissolution a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually   established itselfin spite of all Romanticism in music and   philosophyin which the leaning towards masculine skepticism wa   decidedly prominent whether for instance a fearlessness of gaze a   courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or a resolute will to   dangerous voyage of discovery to spiritualized North Pole expedition   under barren and dangerous sky There may be good ground for it when   warmblooded and superficial humanitarian cross themselves before this   spirit CET ESPRIT FATALISTE IRONIQUE MEPHISTOPHELIQUE a Michelet   call it not without a shudder But if one would realize how   characteristic is this fear of the man in the German spirit which   awakened Europe out of it dogmatic slumber let u call to mind the   former conception which had to be overcome by this new oneand that   it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare with   unbridled presumption to recommend the Germans to the interest of   Europe a gentle goodhearted weakwilled and poetical fool   Finally let u only understand profoundly enough Napoleons   astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for   century a the German spirit VOILA UN HOMMEthat wa a much a   to say But this is a MAN And I only expected to see a German     210 Supposing then that in the picture of the philosopher of the   future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps   be skeptic in the lastmentioned sense something in them would only be   designated therebyand not they themselves With equal right they might   call themselves critic and assuredly they will be men of experiment   By the name with which I ventured to baptize them I have already   expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is   this because a critic in body and soul they will love to make use   of experiment in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense In   their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and   painful attempt than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic   century can approve ofThere is no doubt these coming one will be   least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous quality   which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty a to   standard of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method   the wary courage the standingalone and the capacity for   selfresponsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT   in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which know   how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds   They will be STERNER and perhaps not always towards themselves only   than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in   order that it may please them or elevate and inspire themthey   will rather have little faith in TRUTH bringing with it such revel   for the feeling They will smile those rigorous spirit when any one   say in their presence That thought elevates me why should it not be   true or That work enchants me why should it not be beautiful or   That artist enlarges me why should he not be great Perhaps they   will not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thus   rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one   could look into their inmost heart he would not easily find therein   the intention to reconcile Christian sentiment with antique taste   or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliation   necessarily found even among philosopher in our very uncertain and   consequently very conciliatory century Critical discipline and every   habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matter   will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosopher of   the future they may even make a display thereof a their special   adornmentnevertheless they will not want to be called critic on that   account It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to   have it decreed a is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is   criticism and critical scienceand nothing else whatever Though this   estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of   France and Germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste   of KANT let u call to mind the title of his principal work our new   philosopher will say notwithstanding that critic are instrument of   the philosopher and just on that account a instrument they are   far from being philosopher themselves Even the great Chinaman of   Konigsberg wa only a great critic     211 I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding   philosophical worker and in general scientific men with   philosophersthat precisely here one should strictly give each his   own and not give those far too much these far too little It may   be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself   should have once stood upon all those step upon which his servant   the scientific worker of philosophy remain standing and MUST remain   standing he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist   and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and   riddlereader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost   everything in order to traverse the whole range of human value   and estimation and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eye and   conscience to look from a height to any distance from a depth up   to any height from a nook into any expanse But all these are only   preliminary condition for his task this task itself demand something   elseit requires him TO CREATE VALUES The philosophical worker after   the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel have to fix and formalize some   great existing body of valuationsthat is to say former DETERMINATIONS   OF VALUE creation of value which have become prevalent and are for   a time called truthswhether in the domain of the LOGICAL the   POLITICAL moral or the ARTISTIC It is for these investigator to   make whatever ha happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous   conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long   even time itself and to SUBJUGATE the entire past an immense and   wonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride all   tenacious will can surely find satisfaction THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS   HOWEVER ARE COMMANDERS AND LAWGIVERS they say Thus SHALL it be   They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind and thereby   set aside the previous labour of all philosophical worker and all   subjugator of the pastthey grasp at the future with a creative   hand and whatever is and wa becomes for them thereby a mean an   instrument and a hammer Their knowing is CREATING their creating   is a lawgiving their will to truth isWILL TO POWERAre there at   present such philosopher Have there ever been such philosopher MUST   there not be such philosopher some day      212 It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher a a man   INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow ha ever   found himself and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself in contradiction   to the day in which he life his enemy ha always been the ideal of his   day Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one   call philosopherswho rarely regarded themselves a lover of wisdom   but rather a disagreeable fool and dangerous interrogatorshave found   their mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end   however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of   their age In putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the very   VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE they have betrayed their own secret it ha been   for the sake of a NEW greatness of man a new untrodden path to   his aggrandizement They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy   indolence selfindulgence and selfneglect how much falsehood wa   concealed under the most venerated type of contemporary morality how   much virtue wa OUTLIVED they have always said We must remove hence to   where YOU are least at home In the face of a world of modern idea   which would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty a   philosopher if there could be philosopher nowadays would be compelled   to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely   in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his allroundness he   would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety   of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the   EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the   taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is   so adapted to the spirit of the age a weakness of will consequently in   the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity   for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception   of greatness with a good a right a the opposite doctrine with it   ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity wa suited to   an opposite agesuch a the sixteenth century which suffered from it   accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrent and flood   of selfishness In the time of Socrates among men only of wornout   instinct old conservative Athenians who let themselves gofor the   sake of happiness a they said for the sake of pleasure a their   conduct indicatedand who had continually on their lip the old pompous   word to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led   IRONY wa perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked Socratic   assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his   own flesh a into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that   said plainly enough Do not dissemble before me herewe are equal   At present on the contrary when throughout Europe the herdinganimal   alone attains to honour and dispenses honour when equality of   right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrongI mean to   say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged   against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher   responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordlinessat present   it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to be   apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live   by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his   own ideal when he asserts He shall be the greatest who can be the most   solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good   and evil the master of his virtue and of superabundance of will   precisely this shall be called GREATNESS a diversified a can be   entire a ample a can be full And to ask once more the question Is   greatness POSSIBLEnowadays     213 It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it can not   be taught one must know it by experienceor one should have the   pride NOT to know it The fact that at present people all talk of thing   of which they CANNOT have any experience is true more especially   and unfortunately a concern the philosopher and philosophical   mattersthe very few know them are permitted to know them and   all popular idea about them are false Thus for instance the truly   philosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which run   at presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which make no   false step is unknown to most thinker and scholar from their own   experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their   presence it is incredible to them They conceive of every necessity a   troublesome a a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint   thinking itself is regarded by them a something slow and hesitating   almost a a trouble and often enough a worthy of the SWEAT of the   noblebut not at all a something easy and divine closely related   to dancing and exuberance To think and to take a matter seriously   arduouslythat is one and the same thing to them such only ha been   their experienceArtists have here perhaps a finer intuition they   who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything   arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom   of subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shaping   reach it climaxin short that necessity and freedom of will are   then the same thing with them There is in fine a gradation of rank   in psychical state to which the gradation of rank in the problem   corresponds and the highest problem repel ruthlessly every one who   venture too near them without being predestined for their solution   by the loftiness and power of his spirituality Of what use is it for   nimble everyday intellect or clumsy honest mechanic and empiricist   to press in their plebeian ambition close to such problem and a   it were into this holy of holiesas so often happens nowadays But   coarse foot must never tread upon such carpet this is provided for in   the primary law of thing the door remain closed to those intruder   though they may dash and break their head thereon People have always   to be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be BRED   for it a person ha only a right to philosophytaking the word in   it higher significancein virtue of his descent the ancestor the   blood decide here also Many generation must have prepared the way   for the coming of the philosopher each of his virtue must have been   separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the   bold easy delicate course and current of his thought but above all   the readiness for great responsibility the majesty of ruling glance   and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with   their duty and virtue the kindly patronage and defense of whatever   is misunderstood and calumniated be it God or devil the delight and   practice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude of   will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely look up rarely   love         CHAPTER VII OUR VIRTUES       214 OUR VirtuesIt is probable that we too have still our virtue   although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtue on   account of which we hold our grandfather in esteem and also at a little   distance from u We Europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlings   of the twentieth centurywith all our dangerous curiosity our   multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly   sweetened cruelty in sense and spiritwe shall presumably IF we must   have virtue have those only which have come to agreement with our most   secret and heartfelt inclination with our most ardent requirement   well then let u look for them in our labyrinthswhere a we know   so many thing lose themselves so many thing get quite lost And is   there anything finer than to SEARCH for one own virtue Is it not   almost to BELIEVE in one own virtue But this believing in one   own virtuesis it not practically the same a what wa formerly called   one good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea   which our grandfather used to hang behind their head and often enough   also behind their understanding It seems therefore that however   little we may imagine ourselves to be oldfashioned and grandfatherly   respectable in other respect in one thing we are nevertheless the   worthy grandchild of our grandfather we last Europeans with good   conscience we also still wear their pigtailAh if you only knew how   soon so very soonit will be different     215 As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two sun which   determine the path of one planet and in certain case sun of different   colour shine around a single planet now with red light now with   green and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley   colour so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our   firmament are determined by DIFFERENT morality our action shine   alternately in different colour and are seldom unequivocaland there   are often case also in which our action are MOTLEYCOLOURED     216 To love one enemy I think that ha been well learnt it take   place thousand of time at present on a large and small scale indeed   at time the higher and sublimer thing take placewe learn to DESPISE   when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however   unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and   secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word   and the formula of virtue Morality a attitudeis opposed to our taste   nowadays This is ALSO an advance a it wa an advance in our father   that religion a an attitude finally became opposed to their taste   including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion and all   that formerly belonged to freethinkerpantomime It is the music in our   conscience the dance in our spirit to which Puritan litany moral   sermon and goodygoodness wo nt chime     217 Let u be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance   to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment   They never forgive u if they have once made a mistake BEFORE u   or even with REGARD to usthey inevitably become our instinctive   calumniators and detractor even when they still remain our   friendsBlessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of   their blunder     218 The psychologist of Franceand where else are there still   psychologist nowadayshave never yet exhausted their bitter and   manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just a though in   short they betray something thereby Flaubert for instance the honest   citizen of Rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the   end it wa his mode of selftorment and refined cruelty As this is   growing wearisome I would now recommend for a change something else   for a pleasurenamely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat   honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirit and the task   they have to perform the subtle barbed Jesuitical astuteness which   is a thousand time subtler than the taste and understanding of the   middleclass in it best momentssubtler even than the understanding of   it victimsa repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent   of all kind of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered In   short you psychologist study the philosophy of the rule in it   struggle with the exception there you have a spectacle fit for Gods   and godlike malignity Or in plainer word practise vivisection on   good people on the homo bonae voluntatis ON YOURSELVES     219 The practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite   revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are le so it is   also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature   and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING   subtlemalice spiritualises They are glad in their inmost heart that   there is a standard according to which those who are overendowed with   intellectual good and privilege are equal to them they contend for   the equality of all before God and almost NEED the belief in God for   this purpose It is among them that the most powerful antagonist of   atheism are found If any one were to say to them A lofty spirituality   is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely   moral manit would make them furious I shall take care not to say   so I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality   itself exists only a the ultimate product of moral quality that it   is a synthesis of all quality attributed to the merely moral man   after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice   perhaps during a whole series of generation that lofty spirituality   is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severity   which know that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the   world even among thingsand not only among men     220 Now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular   one mustprobably not without some dangerget an idea of WHAT people   actually take an interest in and what are the thing generally which   fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary menincluding the   cultured even the learned and perhaps philosopher also if   appearance do not deceive The fact thereby becomes obvious that the   greater part of what interest and charm higher nature and more   refined and fastidious taste seems absolutely uninteresting to   the average manif notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these   interest he call it desinteresse and wonder how it is possible to   act disinterestedly There have been philosopher who could give this   popular astonishment a seductive and mystical otherworldly expression   perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience   instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that   disinterested action is very interesting and interested action   provided that And loveWhat Even an action for love sake   shall be unegoistic But you fool And the praise of the   selfsacrificerBut whoever ha really offered sacrifice know that   he wanted and obtained something for itperhaps something from himself   for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have   more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more   But this is a realm of question and answer in which a more fastidious   spirit doe not like to stay for here truth ha to stifle her yawn so   much when she is obliged to answer And after all truth is a woman one   must not use force with her     221 It sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant and   trifleretailer that I honour and respect an unselfish man not   however because he is unselfish but because I think he ha a right to   be useful to another man at his own expense In short the question   is always who HE is and who THE OTHER is For instance in a person   created and destined for command selfdenial and modest retirement   instead of being virtue would be the waste of virtue so it seems   to me Every system of unegoistic morality which take itself   unconditionally and appeal to every one not only sin against good   taste but is also an incentive to sin of omission an ADDITIONAL   seduction under the mask of philanthropyand precisely a seduction and   injury to the higher rarer and more privileged type of men Moral   system must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF   RANK their presumption must be driven home to their conscienceuntil   they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that what   is right for one is proper for anotherSo said my moralistic pedant   and bonhomme Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus   exhorted system of moral to practise morality But one should not be   too much in the right if one wish to have the laugher on ONES OWN   side a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste     222 Wherever sympathy fellowsuffering is preached nowadaysand   if I gather rightly no other religion is any longer preachedlet the   psychologist have his ear open through all the vanity through all the   noise which is natural to these preacher a to all preacher he will   hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of SELFCONTEMPT It belongs   to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe which ha been on   the increase for a century the first symptom of which are already   specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame   dEpinayIF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF The man of   modern idea the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied with   himselfthis is perfectly certain He suffers and his vanity want him   only to suffer with his fellow     223 The hybrid Europeana tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in   allabsolutely requires a costume he need history a a storeroom   of costume To be sure he notice that none of the costume fit him   properlyhe change and change Let u look at the nineteenth century   with respect to these hasty preference and change in it masquerade   of style and also with respect to it moment of desperation on account   of nothing suiting u It is in vain to get ourselves up a romantic   or classical or Christian or Florentine or barocco or national   in moribus et artibus it doe not clothe u But the spirit   especially the historical spirit profit even by this desperation   once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested   put on taken off packed up and above all studiedwe are the first   studious age in puncto of costume I mean a concern moral   article of belief artistic taste and religion we are prepared a   no other age ha ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the   most spiritual festivallaughter and arrogance for the transcendental   height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world Perhaps   we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the   domain where even we can still be original probably a parodist of   the world history and a Gods MerryAndrewsperhaps though nothing   else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a   future     224 The historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly   the order of rank of the valuation according to which a people a   community or an individual ha lived the divining instinct for the   relationship of these valuation for the relation of the authority   of the valuation to the authority of the operating forcesthis   historical sense which we Europeans claim a our specialty ha come   to u in the train of the enchanting and mad semibarbarity into which   Europe ha been plunged by the democratic mingling of class and   racesit is only the nineteenth century that ha recognized this   faculty a it sixth sense Owing to this mingling the past of every   form and mode of life and of culture which were formerly closely   contiguous and superimposed on one another flow forth into u modern   soul our instinct now run back in all direction we ourselves are   a kind of chaos in the end a we have said the spirit perceives it   advantage therein By mean of our semibarbarity in body and in desire   we have secret access everywhere such a a noble age never had we have   access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilization and to   every form of semibarbarity that ha at any time existed on earth and   in so far a the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto   ha just been semibarbarity the historical sense implies almost the   sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything   whereby it immediately prof itself to be an IGNOBLE sense For   instance we enjoy Homer once more it is perhaps our happiest   acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer whom men of   distinguished culture a the French of the seventeenth century like   SaintEvremond who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE and even   Voltaire the last echo of the century can not and could not so easily   appropriatewhom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy The very   decided Yea and Nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their   hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of   the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of   every distinguished and selfsufficing culture to avow a new desire   a dissatisfaction with it own condition or an admiration of what is   strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards   the best thing of the world which are not their property or could not   become their preyand no faculty is more unintelligible to such men   than just this historical sense with it truckling plebeian   curiosity The case is not different with Shakespeare that marvelous   SpanishMoorishSaxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient Athenian   of the circle of AEschylus would have halfkilled himself with laughter   or irritation but weaccept precisely this wild motleyness this   medley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificial   with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it a a refinement   of art reserved expressly for u and allow ourselves to be a little   disturbed by the repulsive fume and the proximity of the English   populace in which Shakespeares art and taste life a perhaps on   the Chiaja of Naples where with all our sens awake we go our way   enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drainodour of the lower   quarter of the town That a men of the historical sense we have   our virtue is not to be disputedwe are unpretentious unselfish   modest brave habituated to selfcontrol and selfrenunciation very   grateful very patient very complaisantbut with all this we are   perhaps not very tasteful Let u finally confess it that what is   most difficult for u men of the historical sense to grasp feel   taste and love what find u fundamentally prejudiced and almost   hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every   culture and art the essentially noble in work and men their moment   of smooth sea and halcyon selfsufficiency the goldenness and coldness   which all thing show that have perfected themselves Perhaps our great   virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste   at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves   imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and   happy godsend and glorification of human life a they shine here and   there those moment and marvelous experience when a great power ha   voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinitewhen a   superabundance of refined delight ha been enjoyed by a sudden checking   and petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still   trembling ground PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to u let u confess it   to ourselves our itching is really the itching for the infinite the   immeasurable Like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the   rein fall before the infinite we modern men we semibarbariansand   are only in OUR highest bliss when weARE IN MOST DANGER     225 Whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism   all those mode of thinking which measure the worth of thing according   to PLEASURE and PAIN that is according to accompanying circumstance   and secondary consideration are plausible mode of thought and   naivete which every one conscious of CREATIVE power and an artist   conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy   Sympathy for youto be sure that is not sympathy a you understand   it it is not sympathy for social distress for society with it   sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie   on the ground around u still le is it sympathy for the grumbling   vexed revolutionary slaveclasses who strive after powerthey call it   freedom OUR sympathy is a loftier and furthersighted sympathywe   see how MAN dwarf himself how YOU dwarf him and there are moment   when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist   itwhen we regard your seriousness a more dangerous than any kind   of levity You want if possibleand there is not a more foolish if   possibleTO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING and weit really seems that WE   would rather have it increased and made worse than it ha ever been   Wellbeing a you understand itis certainly not a goal it seems   to u an END a condition which at once render man ludicrous and   contemptibleand make his destruction DESIRABLE The discipline   of suffering of GREAT sufferingknow ye not that it is only THIS   discipline that ha produced all the elevation of humanity hitherto   The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it it energy   it shuddering in view of rack and ruin it inventiveness and bravery   in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and   whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness ha   been bestowed upon the soulhas it not been bestowed through suffering   through the discipline of great suffering In man CREATURE and CREATOR   are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire   folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness   of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh daydo   ye understand this contrast And that YOUR sympathy for the creature   in man applies to that which ha to be fashioned bruised forged   stretched roasted annealed refinedto that which must necessarily   SUFFER and IS MEANT to suffer And our sympathydo ye not understand   what our REVERSE sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy a   the worst of all pampering and enervationSo it is sympathy AGAINST   sympathyBut to repeat it once more there are higher problem than   the problem of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all system of   philosophy which deal only with these are naivete     226 WE IMMORALISTSThis world with which WE are concerned in which   we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of   delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every   respect captious insidious sharp and tenderyes it is well   protected from clumsy spectator and familiar curiosity We are   woven into a strong net and garment of duty and CANNOT disengage   ourselvesprecisely here we are men of duty even we Occasionally   it is true we dance in our chain and betwixt our sword it   is none the le true that more often we gnash our teeth under the   circumstance and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot But   do what we will fool and appearance say of u These are men WITHOUT   dutywe have always fool and appearance against u     227 Honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we can not rid   ourselves we free spiritswell we will labour at it with all our   perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in OUR   virtue which alone remains may it glance some day overspread like   a gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with it dull   gloomy seriousness And if nevertheless our honesty should one day   grow weary and sigh and stretch it limb and find u too hard and   would fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeable   vice let u remain HARD we latest Stoics and let u send to it   help whatever devilry we have in usour disgust at the clumsy   and undefined our NITIMUR IN VETITUM our love of adventure   our sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguised   intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest which ramble and   roves avidiously around all the realm of the futurelet u go with all   our devil to the help of our God It is probable that people will   misunderstand and mistake u on that account what doe it matter They   will say Their honestythat is their devilry and nothing else   What doe it matter And even if they were righthave not all Gods   hitherto been such sanctified rebaptized devil And after all what   do we know of ourselves And what the spirit that lead u want TO BE   CALLED It is a question of name And how many spirit we harbour   Our honesty we free spiritslet u be careful lest it become our   vanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity   Every virtue incline to stupidity every stupidity to virtue stupid   to the point of sanctity they say in Russialet u be careful lest   out of pure honesty we eventually become saint and bore Is not life   a hundred time too short for usto bore ourselves One would have to   believe in eternal life in order to     228 I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy   hitherto ha been tedious and ha belonged to the soporific   appliancesand that virtue in my opinion ha been MORE injured   by the TEDIOUSNESS of it advocate than by anything else at the same   time however I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness It   is desirable that a few people a possible should reflect upon moral   and consequently it is very desirable that moral should not some day   become interesting But let u not be afraid Things still remain today   a they have always been I see no one in Europe who ha or DISCLOSES   an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning moral might be   conducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring mannerthat CALAMITY   might be involved therein Observe for example the indefatigable   inevitable English utilitarian how ponderously and respectably they   stalk on stalk along a Homeric metaphor express it better in the   footstep of Bentham just a he had already stalked in the footstep of   the respectable Helvetius no he wa not a dangerous man Helvetius   CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE to use an expression of Galiani No new   thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression   of an old thought not even a proper history of what ha been previously   thought on the subject an IMPOSSIBLE literature taking it all in all   unless one know how to leaven it with some mischief In effect the   old English vice called CANT which is MORAL TARTUFFISM ha insinuated   itself also into these moralist whom one must certainly read with an   eye to their motif if one MUST read them concealed this time under   the new form of the scientific spirit moreover there is not absent   from them a secret struggle with the pang of conscience from which a   race of former Puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientific   tinkering with moral Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan   That is to say a a thinker who regard morality a questionable   a worthy of interrogation in short a a problem Is moralizing   notimmoral In the end they all want English morality to be   recognized a authoritative inasmuch a mankind or the general   utility or the happiness of the greatest numberno the happiness   of ENGLAND will be best served thereby They would like by all mean   to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness I   mean after COMFORT and FASHION and in the highest instance a seat in   Parliament is at the same time the true path of virtue in fact that   in so far a there ha been virtue in the world hitherto it ha   just consisted in such striving Not one of those ponderous   consciencestricken herdinganimals who undertake to advocate the   cause of egoism a conducive to the general welfare want to have   any knowledge or inkling of the fact that the general welfare is   no ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only a   nostrumthat what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another   that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to   higher men in short that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man   and man and consequently between morality and morality They are an   unassuming and fundamentally mediocre specie of men these utilitarian   Englishmen and a already remarked in so far a they are tedious one   can not think highly enough of their utility One ought even to ENCOURAGE   them a ha been partially attempted in the following rhyme         Hail ye worthy barrowwheeling       Longerbetter aye revealing         Stiffer aye in head and knee       Unenraptured never jesting       Mediocre everlasting         SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT       229 In these later age which may be proud of their humanity there   still remains so much fear so much SUPERSTITION of the fear of the   cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of   these humaner agesthat even obvious truth a if by the agreement   of century have long remained unuttered because they have the   appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again   I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape let   others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment   FOOTNOTE An expression from Schillers William Tell Act IV Scene   3 to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in it old   cornerOne ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one eye   one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest   gross errorsas for instance have been fostered by ancient and   modern philosopher with regard to tragedymay no longer wander about   virtuously and boldly Almost everything that we call higher culture   is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTYthis is   my thesis the wild beast ha not been slain at all it life it   flourish it ha only beentransfigured That which constitutes the   painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in   socalled tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime   up to the highest and most delicate thrill of metaphysics obtains it   sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty What the   Roman enjoys in the arena the Christian in the ecstasy of the cross   the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bullfight   the presentday Japanese who press his way to the tragedy the workman   of the Parisian suburb who ha a homesickness for bloody revolution   the Wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance of   Tristan and Isoldewhat all these enjoy and strive with mysterious   ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great Circe cruelty Here   to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of   former time which could only teach with regard to cruelty that   it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS there is an   abundant superabundant enjoyment even in one own suffering in   causing one own sufferingand wherever man ha allowed himself to be   persuaded to selfdenial in the RELIGIOUS sense or to selfmutilation   a among the Phoenicians and ascetic or in general to   desensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to Puritanical   repentancespasms to vivisection of conscience and to Pascallike   SACRIFIZIA DELL INTELLETO he is secretly allured and impelled   forward by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS   HIMSELFFinally let u consider that even the seeker of knowledge   operates a an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels his   spirit to perceive AGAINST it own inclination and often enough against   the wish of his hearthe force it to say Nay where he would like   to affirm love and adore indeed every instance of taking a thing   profoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuring   of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aim at   appearance and superficialityeven in every desire for knowledge there   is a drop of cruelty     230 Perhaps what I have said here about a fundamental will of the   spirit may not be understood without further detail I may be allowed   a word of explanationThat imperious something which is popularly   called the spirit wish to be master internally and externally   and to feel itself master it ha the will of a multiplicity for a   simplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will   Its requirement and capacity here are the same a those assigned by   physiologist to everything that life grows and multiplies The power   of the spirit to appropriate foreign element reveals itself in a strong   tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifold   to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just a it   arbitrarily reunderlines make prominent and falsifies for itself   certain trait and line in the foreign element in every portion of   the outside world Its object thereby is the incorporation of new   experience the assortment of new thing in the old arrangementsin   short growth or more properly the FEELING of growth the feeling of   increased poweris it object This same will ha at it service an   apparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preference   of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of window an inner   denial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensive   attitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscurity   with the shuttingin horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance   a that which is all necessary according to the degree of it   appropriating power it digestive power to speak figuratively and   in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else Here   also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be   deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so   but is only allowed to pas a such a delight in uncertainty and   ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary outoftheway narrowness   and mystery of the toonear of the foreground of the magnified   the diminished the misshapen the beautifiedan enjoyment of the   arbitrariness of all these manifestation of power Finally in this   connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to   deceive other spirit and dissemble before themthe constant pressing   and straining of a creating shaping changeable power the spirit   enjoys therein it craftiness and it variety of disguise it enjoys   also it feeling of security thereinit is precisely by it Protean   art that it is best protected and concealedCOUNTER TO this   propensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for a   cloak in short for an outsidefor every outside is a cloakthere   operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which take and   INSISTS on taking thing profoundly variously and thoroughly a a   kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every   courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided a it ought   to be that he ha sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for   introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe   word He will say There is something cruel in the tendency of my   spirit let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not   so In fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps   our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and   glorifiedwe free VERY free spiritsand some day perhaps SUCH will   actually be ourposthumous glory Meanwhilefor there is plenty of   time until thenwe should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in   such florid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work ha   just made u sick of this taste and it sprightly exuberance They are   beautiful glistening jingling festive word honesty love of truth   love of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthfulthere   is something in them that make one heart swell with pride But we   anchorite and marmot have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the   secrecy of an anchorite conscience that this worthy parade of   verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and   golddust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such   flattering colour and repainting the terrible original text HOMO NATURA   must again be recognized In effect to translate man back again into   nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretation and   subordinate meaning which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over   the eternal original text HOMO NATURA to bring it about that man shall   henceforth stand before man a he now hardened by the discipline   of science stand before the OTHER form of nature with fearless   Oedipuseyes and stopped Ulyssesears deaf to the enticement of old   metaphysical birdcatchers who have piped to him far too long Thou   art more thou art higher thou hast a different originthis may be   a strange and foolish task but that it is a TASK who can deny Why did   we choose it this foolish task Or to put the question differently   Why knowledge at all Every one will ask u about this And thus   pressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred time have   not found and can not find any better answer     231 Learning alters u it doe what all nourishment doe that doe not   merely conserveas the physiologist know But at the bottom of our   soul quite down below there is certainly something unteachable   a granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to   predetermined chosen question In each cardinal problem there speaks   an unchangeable I am this a thinker can not learn anew about man and   woman for instance but can only learn fullyhe can only follow to the   end what is fixed about them in himself Occasionally we find certain   solution of problem which make strong belief for u perhaps they   are henceforth called conviction Later onone see in them only   footstep to selfknowledge guidepost to the problem which we   ourselves AREor more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody   our spiritual fate the UNTEACHABLE in u quite down belowIn view   of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself permission   will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truth about   woman a she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally   they are merelyMY truth     232 Woman wish to be independent and therefore she begin to   enlighten men about woman a she isTHIS is one of the worst   development of the general UGLIFYING of Europe For what must these   clumsy attempt of feminine scientificality and selfexposure bring   to light Woman ha so much cause for shame in woman there is so   much pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumption   unbridledness and indiscretion concealedstudy only woman behaviour   towards childrenwhich ha really been best restrained and dominated   hitherto by the FEAR of man Alas if ever the eternally tedious in   womanshe ha plenty of itis allowed to venture forth if she   begin radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and artof   charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and   taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable   desire Female voice are already raised which by Saint Aristophanes   make one afraidwith medical explicitness it is stated in a   threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man Is   it not in the very worst taste that woman thus set herself up to be   scientific Enlightenment hitherto ha fortunately been men affair   men giftwe remained therewith among ourselves and in the end   in view of all that woman write about woman we may well have   considerable doubt a to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment   about herselfand CAN desire it If woman doe not thereby seek a new   ORNAMENT for herselfI believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally   femininewhy then she wish to make herself feared perhaps she   thereby wish to get the mastery But she doe not want truthwhat   doe woman care for truth From the very first nothing is more foreign   more repugnant or more hostile to woman than truthher great art is   falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty Let u confess   it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in   woman we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek the   company of being under whose hand glance and delicate folly our   seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like folly to   u Finally I ask the question Did a woman herself ever acknowledge   profundity in a woman mind or justice in a woman heart And is it   not true that on the whole woman ha hitherto been most despised by   woman herself and not at all by usWe men desire that woman should   not continue to compromise herself by enlightening u just a it wa   man care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed   mulier taceat in ecclesia It wa to the benefit of woman when Napoleon   gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand mulier taceat in   politicisand in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who call   out to woman today mulier taceat de mulierel     233 It betrays corruption of the instinctsapart from the fact that   it betrays bad tastewhen a woman refers to Madame Roland or Madame de   Stael or Monsieur George Sand a though something were proved thereby   in favour of woman a she is Among men these are the three comical   woman a they arenothing moreand just the best involuntary   counterargument against feminine emancipation and autonomy     234 Stupidity in the kitchen woman a cook the terrible   thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of   the house is managed Woman doe not understand what food mean and she   insists on being cook If woman had been a thinking creature she should   certainly a cook for thousand of year have discovered the most   important physiological fact and should likewise have got possession   of the healing art Through bad female cooksthrough the entire lack   of reason in the kitchenthe development of mankind ha been longest   retarded and most interfered with even today matter are very little   better A word to High

treated by men like bird which losing   their way have come down among them from an elevation a something   delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animatingbut a something   also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away     238 To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman to   deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally   hostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal right equal   training equal claim and obligation that is a TYPICAL sign of   shallowmindedness and a thinker who ha proved himself shallow at   this dangerous spotshallow in instinctmay generally be regarded a   suspicious nay more a betrayed a discovered he will probably prove   too short for all fundamental question of life future a well a   present and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depth On the   other hand a man who ha depth of spirit a well a of desire and   ha also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and   harshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman a   ORIENTALS do he must conceive of her a a possession a confinable   property a a being predestined for service and accomplishing her   mission thereinhe must take his stand in this matter upon the immense   rationality of Asia upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia a   the Greeks did formerly those best heir and scholar of Asiawho   a is well known with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power   from Homer to the time of Pericles became gradually STRICTER towards   woman in short more Oriental HOW necessary HOW logical even HOW   humanely desirable this wa let u consider for ourselves     239 The weaker sex ha in no previous age been treated with so   much respect by men a at presentthis belongs to the tendency and   fundamental taste of democracy in the same way a disrespectfulness to   old agewhat wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of   this respect They want more they learn to make claim the tribute   of respect is at last felt to be wellnigh galling rivalry for right   indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in a word woman is   losing modesty And let u immediately add that she is also losing   taste She is unlearning to FEAR man but the woman who unlearns to   fear sacrifice her most womanly instinct That woman should venture   forward when the fearinspiring quality in manor more definitely   the MAN in manis no longer either desired or fully developed is   reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difficult   to understand is that precisely therebywoman deteriorates This is   what is happening nowadays let u not deceive ourselves about it   Wherever the industrial spirit ha triumphed over the military   and aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legal   independence of a clerk woman a clerkess is inscribed on the portal   of the modern society which is in course of formation While she   thus appropriates new right aspires to be master and inscribes   progress of woman on her flag and banner the very opposite realises   itself with terrible obviousness WOMAN RETROGRADES Since the French   Revolution the influence of woman in Europe ha DECLINED in proportion   a she ha increased her right and claim and the emancipation of   woman insofar a it is desired and demanded by woman themselves and   not only by masculine shallowpates thus prof to be a remarkable   symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly   instinct There is STUPIDITY in this movement an almost masculine   stupidity of which a wellreared womanwho is always a sensible   womanmight be heartily ashamed To lose the intuition a to the ground   upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in   the use of her proper weapon to letherselfgo before man perhaps   even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in   refined artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man   faith in a VEILED fundamentally different ideal in woman something   eternally necessarily feminine to emphatically and loquaciously   dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared for   protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and   often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of   everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of   woman in the hitherto existing order of society ha entailed and still   entail a though slavery were a counterargument and not rather a   condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culturewhat   doe all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instinct   a defeminising Certainly there are enough of idiotic friend and   corrupters of woman among the learned ass of the masculine sex who   advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate   all the stupidity from which man in Europe European manliness   sufferswho would like to lower woman to general culture indeed   even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics Here and there   they wish even to make woman into free spirit and literary worker a   though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious   or ludicrous to a profound and godless manalmost everywhere her   nerve are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music   our latest German music and she is daily being made more hysterical   and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that of   bearing robust child They wish to cultivate her in general still   more and intend a they say to make the weaker sex STRONG by   culture a if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that   the cultivating of mankind and his weakeningthat is to say the   weakening dissipating and languishing of his FORCE OF WILLhave   always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and   influential woman in the world and lastly the mother of Napoleon   had just to thank their force of willand not their schoolmastersfor   their power and ascendancy over men That which inspires respect   in woman and often enough fear also is her NATURE which is more   natural than that of man her genuine carnivoralike cunning   flexibility her tigerclaws beneath the glove her NAIVETE in egoism   her untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensibleness   extent and deviation of her desire and virtue That which in spite   of fear excites one sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat   woman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable more   necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any   other creature Fear and sympathy it is with these feeling that man ha   hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in   tragedy which rends while it delightsWhat And all that is now to   be at an end And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress The   tediousness of woman is slowly evolving Oh Europe Europe We know   the horned animal which wa always most attractive to thee from which   danger is ever again threatening thee Thy old fable might once more   become historyan immense stupidity might once again overmaster   thee and carry thee away And no God concealed beneath itno only an   idea a modern idea         CHAPTER VIII PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES       240 I HEARD once again for the first time Richard Wagners overture   to the Mastersinger it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavy   latterday art which ha the pride to presuppose two century of music   a still living in order that it may be understoodit is an honour   to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate What flavour   and force what season and clime do we not find mingled in it It   impress u at one time a ancient at another time a foreign bitter   and too modern it is a arbitrary a it is pompously traditional it   is not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarseit ha fire   and courage and at the same time the loose duncoloured skin of fruit   which ripen too late It flow broad and full and suddenly there is a   moment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that open between cause   and effect an oppression that make u dream almost a nightmare but   already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delightthe most   manifold delightof old and new happiness including ESPECIALLY   the joy of the artist in himself which he refuse to conceal his   astonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedient here   employed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedient of art   which he apparently betrays to u All in all however no beauty no   South nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothing   of grace no dance hardly a will to logic a certain clumsiness even   which is also emphasized a though the artist wished to say to u It   is part of my intention a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarily   barbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceit   and witticism something German in the best and worst sense of   the word something in the German style manifold formless and   inexhaustible a certain German potency and superplenitude of   soul which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of   decadencewhich perhaps feel itself most at ease there a real   genuine token of the German soul which is at the same time young and   aged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity This kind of music   express best what I think of the Germans they belong to the day   before yesterday and the day after tomorrowTHEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY     241 We good Europeans we also have hour when we allow ourselves a   warmhearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old love and narrow   viewsI have just given an example of ithours of national excitement   of patriotic anguish and all other sort of oldfashioned flood of   sentiment Duller spirit may perhaps only get done with what confines   it operation in u to hour and play itself out in hoursin a   considerable time some in half a year others in half a lifetime   according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change   their material Indeed I could think of sluggish hesitating race   which even in our rapidly moving Europe would require half a century   ere they could surmount such atavistic attack of patriotism and   soilattachment and return once more to reason that is to say to   good Europeanism And while digressing on this possibility I   happen to become an earwitness of a conversation between two old   patriotsthey were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently   spoke all the louder HE ha a much and know a much philosophy a   a peasant or a corpsstudent said the onehe is still innocent But   what doe that matter nowadays It is the age of the mass they lie on   their belly before everything that is massive And so also in politicis   A statesman who rear up for them a new Tower of Babel some monstrosity   of empire and power they call greatwhat doe it matter that we more   prudent and conservative one do not meanwhile give up the old belief   that it is only the great thought that give greatness to an action or   affair Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position   of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which they   were by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would have   to sacrifice their old and reliable virtue out of love to a new and   doubtful mediocritysupposing a statesman were to condemn his people   generally to practise politics when they have hitherto had something   better to do and think about and when in the depth of their soul   they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of   the restlessness emptiness and noisy wrangling of the essentially   politicspractising nationssupposing such a statesman were to   stimulate the slumbering passion and avidity of his people were to   make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness   an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were to   depreciate their most radical proclivity subvert their conscience   make their mind narrow and their taste nationalwhat a statesman   who should do all this which his people would have to do penance for   throughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesman   would be GREAT would heUndoubtedly replied the other old patriot   vehemently otherwise he COULD NOT have done it It wa mad perhaps to   wish such a thing But perhaps everything great ha been just a mad   at it commencementMisuse of word cried his interlocutor   contradictorilystrong strong Strong and mad NOT greatThe old   men had obviously become heated a they thus shouted their truth in   each others face but I in my happiness and apartness considered how   soon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also that   there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a   nationnamely in the deepening of another     242 Whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress   which now distinguishes the European whether we call it simply without   praise or blame by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in   Europebehind all the moral and political foreground pointed to by   such formula an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS go on which is ever   extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans their   increasing detachment from the condition under which climatically and   hereditarily united race originate their increasing independence of   every definite milieu that for century would fain inscribe itself   with equal demand on soul and bodythat is to say the slow emergence   of an essentially SUPERNATIONAL and nomadic specie of man who   posse physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and power   of adaptation a his typical distinction This process of the EVOLVING   EUROPEAN which can be retarded in it TEMPO by great relapse but   will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depththe   stillraging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it   and also the anarchism which is appearing at presentthis process   will probably arrive at result on which it naive propagator and   panegyrist the apostle of modern idea would least care to reckon   The same new condition under which on an average a levelling and   mediocrising of man will take placea useful industrious variously   serviceable and clever gregarious manare in the highest degree   suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and   attractive quality For while the capacity for adaptation which is   every day trying changing condition and begin a new work with every   generation almost with every decade make the POWERFULNESS of the type   impossible while the collective impression of such future Europeans   will probably be that of numerous talkative weakwilled and very   handy workman who REQUIRE a master a commander a they require their   daily bread while therefore the democratising of Europe will tend to   the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle   sense of the term the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and   exceptional case become stronger and richer than he ha perhaps ever   been beforeowing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to   the immense variety of practice art and disguise I meant to say   that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary   arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTStaking the word in all it   meaning even in it most spiritual sense     243 I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the   constellation Hercules and I hope that the men on this earth will do   like the sun And we foremost we good Europeans     244 There wa a time when it wa customary to call Germans deep   by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new   Germanism is covetous of quite other honour and perhaps miss   smartness in all that ha depth it is almost opportune and patriotic   to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that   commendation in short whether German depth is not at bottom something   different and worseand something from which thank God we are on the   point of successfully ridding ourselves Let u try then to relearn   with regard to German depth the only thing necessary for the purpose is   a little vivisection of the German soulThe German soul is above all   manifold varied in it source aggregated and superimposed rather   than actually built this is owing to it origin A German who would   embolden himself to assert Two soul ala dwell in my breast would   make a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far   short of the truth about the number of soul As a people made up of   the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of race perhaps even with a   preponderance of the preAryan element a the people of the centre in   every sense of the term the Germans are more intangible more ample   more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising   and even more terrifying than other people are to themselvesthey   escape DEFINITION and are thereby alone the despair of the French It   IS characteristic of the Germans that the question What is German   never dy out among them Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well   enough We are known they cried jubilantly to himbut Sand also   thought he knew them Jean Paul knew what he wa doing when he declared   himself incensed at Fichtes lying but patriotic flattery and   exaggerationsbut it is probable that Goethe thought differently about   Germans from Jean Paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with   regard to Fichte It is a question what Goethe really thought about the   GermansBut about many thing around him he never spoke explicitly   and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silenceprobably he   had good reason for it It is certain that it wa not the Wars of   Independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it wa   the French Revolutionthe event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED   his Faust and indeed the whole problem of man wa the appearance   of Napoleon There are word of Goethe in which he condemns with   impatient severity a from a foreign land that which Germans take a   pride in he once defined the famous German turn of mind a Indulgence   towards it own and others weakness Was he wrong it is   characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them   The German soul ha passage and gallery in it there are cave   hidingplaces and dungeon therein it disorder ha much of the charm   of the mysterious the German is well acquainted with the bypath to   chaos And a everything love it symbol so the German love the   cloud and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and   shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped   selfdisplacing and growing is deep The German himself doe not   EXIST he is BECOMING he is developing himself Development is   therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain   of philosophical formulasa ruling idea which together with German   beer and German music is labouring to Germanise all Europe Foreigners   are astonished and attracted by the riddle which the conflicting nature   at the basis of the German soul propounds to them riddle which   Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner ha in the end set to music   Goodnatured and spitefulsuch a juxtaposition preposterous in the   case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justified   in Germany one ha only to live for a while among Swabians to know this   The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness   agree alarmingly well with his physical ropedancing and nimble   boldness of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid If any one   wish to see the German soul demonstrated ad oculos let him   only look at German taste at German art and manner what boorish   indifference to taste How the noblest and the commonest stand there   in juxtaposition How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution   of this soul The German DRAGS at his soul he drag at everything he   experience He digest his event badly he never get done   with them and German depth is often only a difficult hesitating   digestion And just a all chronic invalid all dyspeptic like what   is convenient so the German love frankness and honesty it is   so CONVENIENT to be frank and honestThis confidingness this   complaisance this showingthecards of German HONESTY is probably the   most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to   nowadays it is his proper Mephistophelean art with this he can still   achieve much The German let himself go and thereby gaze with   faithful blue empty German eyesand other country immediately   confound him with his dressinggownI meant to say that let German   depth be what it willamong ourselves alone we perhaps take the   liberty to laugh at itwe shall do well to continue henceforth to   honour it appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our   old reputation a a people of depth for Prussian smartness and   Berlin wit and sand It is wise for a people to pose and LET itself   be regarded a profound clumsy goodnatured honest and foolish it   might even beprofound to do so Finally we should do honour to   our namewe are not called the TIUSCHE VOLK deceptive people for   nothing     245 The good old time is past it sang itself out in Mozarthow   happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to u that his good   company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the Chinese and   it flourish his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant the   amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the South can   still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in u Ah some time or other it will be   over with itbut who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with   the intelligence and taste for Beethoven For he wa only the last echo   of a break and transition in style and NOT like Mozart the last echo   of a great European taste which had existed for century Beethoven   is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly   breaking down and a future overyoung soul that is always COMING   there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal   extravagant hopethe same light in which Europe wa bathed when it   dreamed with Rousseau when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the   Revolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon   But how rapidly doe THIS very sentiment now pale how difficult   nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment how strangely doe   the language of Rousseau Schiller Shelley and Byron sound to our ear   in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe wa able to SPEAK which   knew how to SING in BeethovenWhatever German music came afterwards   belongs to Romanticism that is to say to a movement which   historically considered wa still shorter more fleeting and more   superficial than that great interlude the transition of Europe from   Rousseau to Napoleon and to the rise of democracy Weberbut what do   WE care nowadays for Freischutz and Oberon Or Marschners Hans   Heiling and Vampyre Or even Wagners Tannhauser That is extinct   although not yet forgotten music This whole music of Romanticism   besides wa not noble enough wa not musical enough to maintain it   position anywhere but in the theatre and before the mass from the   beginning it wa secondrate music which wa little thought of by   genuine musician It wa different with Felix Mendelssohn that halcyon   master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly   acquired admiration and wa equally quickly forgotten a the beautiful   EPISODE of German music But with regard to Robert Schumann who took   thing seriously and ha been taken seriously from the firsthe   wa the last that founded a schooldo we not now regard it a a   satisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very Romanticism   of Schumanns ha been surmounted Schumann fleeing into the Saxon   Switzerland of his soul with a half Wertherlike half JeanPaullike   nature assuredly not like Beethoven assuredly not like Byronhis   MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of   injustice Schumann with his taste which wa fundamentally a PETTY   taste that is to say a dangerous propensitydoubly dangerous among   Germansfor quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feeling going   constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling who   revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning   a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGEREthis Schumann wa already merely a   GERMAN event in music and no longer a European event a Beethoven had   been a in a still greater degree Mozart had been with Schumann German   music wa threatened with it greatest danger that of LOSING THE VOICE   FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair     246 What a torture are book written in German to a reader who ha a   THIRD ear How indignantly he stand beside the slowly turning swamp   of sound without tune and rhythm without dance which Germans call   a book And even the German who READS book How lazily how   reluctantly how badly he read How many Germans know and consider it   obligatory to know that there is ART in every good sentenceart which   must be divined if the sentence is to be understood If there is a   misunderstanding about it TEMPO for instance the sentence itself   is misunderstood That one must not be doubtful about the   rhythmdetermining syllable that one should feel the breaking of the   toorigid symmetry a intentional and a a charm that one should lend a   fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO that one should   divine the sense in the sequence of the vowel and diphthong and how   delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of   their arrangementwho among bookreading Germans is complaisant enough   to recognize such duty and requirement and to listen to so much art   and intention in language After all one just ha no ear for it   and so the most marked contrast of style are not heard and the most   delicate artistry is a it were SQUANDERED on the deafThese were my   thought when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two master in   the art of prosewriting have been confounded one whose word drop   down hesitatingly and coldly a from the roof of a damp cavehe count   on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language   like a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toe feel the   dangerous bliss of the quivering oversharp blade which wish to   bite hiss and cut     247 How little the German style ha to do with harmony and with the   ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musician themselves   write badly The German doe not read aloud he doe not read for the   ear but only with his eye he ha put his ear away in the drawer for   the time In antiquity when a man readwhich wa seldom enoughhe read   something to himself and in a loud voice they were surprised when   any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it In a   loud voice that is to say with all the swelling inflection and   variation of key and change of TEMPO in which the ancient PUBLIC   world took delight The law of the written style were then the same   a those of the spoken style and these law depended partly on the   surprising development and refined requirement of the ear and larynx   partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lung In   the ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuch   a it is comprised in one breath Such period a occur in Demosthenes   and Cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath   were pleasure to the men of ANTIQUITY who knew by their own schooling   how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficulty   in the deliverance of such a periodWE have really no right to the   BIG period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense Those   ancient indeed were all of them dilettante in speaking consequently   connoisseur consequently criticsthey thus brought their orator to   the highest pitch in the same manner a in the last century when all   Italian lady and gentleman knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song   and with it also the art of melody reached it elevation In Germany   however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began   shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter it young wing there wa   properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical   discoursethat delivered from the pulpit The preacher wa the only one   in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner a   sentence strike spring rush flow and come to a close he alone   had a conscience in his ear often enough a bad conscience for reason   are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom   attained by a German or almost always too late The masterpiece of   German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of it   greatest preacher the BIBLE ha hitherto been the best German   book Compared with Luthers Bible almost everything else is merely   literaturesomething which ha not grown in Germany and therefore   ha not taken and doe not take root in German heart a the Bible ha   done     248 There are two kind of genius one which above all engenders and   seek to engender and another which willingly let itself be fructified   and brings forth And similarly among the gifted nation there are   those on whom the woman problem of pregnancy ha devolved and the   secret task of forming maturing and perfectingthe Greeks for   instance were a nation of this kind and so are the French and others   which have to fructify and become the cause of new mode of lifelike   the Jews the Romans and in all modesty be it asked like the   Germansnations tortured and enraptured by unknown fever and   irresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing for   foreign race for such a let themselves be fructified and withal   imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force   and consequently empowered by the grace of God These two kind of   genius seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand   each otherlike man and woman     249 Every nation ha it own Tartuffery and call that it   virtueOne doe not knowcannot know the best that is in one     250 What Europe owes to the JewsMany thing good and bad and above   all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand   style in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demand of   infinite signification the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral   questionablenessand consequently just the most attractive ensnaring   and exquisite element in those iridescence and allurement to life   in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture it evening   sky now glowsperhaps glow out For this we artist among the   spectator and philosopher aregrateful to the Jews     251 It must be taken into the bargain if various cloud and   disturbancesin short slight attack of stupiditypass over the   spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national   nervous fever and political ambition for instance among presentday   Germans there is alternately the antiFrench folly the antiSemitic   folly the antiPolish folly the Christianromantic folly the   Wagnerian folly the Teutonic folly the Prussian folly just look at   those poor historian the Sybels and Treitschkes and their closely   bandaged head and whatever else these little obscurations of the   German spirit and conscience may be called May it be forgiven me that   I too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not   remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began   to entertain thought about matter which did not concern methe first   symptom of political infection About the Jews for instance listen   to the followingI have never yet met a German who wa favourably   inclined to the Jews and however decided the repudiation of actual   antiSemitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men this   prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the   sentiment itself but only against it dangerous excess and especially   against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of   sentimenton this point we must not deceive ourselves That Germany   ha amply SUFFICIENT Jews that the German stomach the German blood   ha difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of this   quantity of Jewas the Italian the Frenchman and the Englishman   have done by mean of a stronger digestionthat is the unmistakable   declaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listen   and according to which one must act Let no more Jews come in And shut   the door especially towards the East also towards Austriathus   command the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and   uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by   a stronger race The Jews however are beyond all doubt the strongest   toughest and purest race at present living in Europe they know how   to succeed even under the worst condition in fact better than under   favourable one by mean of virtue of some sort which one would like   nowadays to label a vicesowing above all to a resolute faith which   doe not need to be ashamed before modern idea they alter only   WHEN they do alter in the same way that the Russian Empire make   it conquestas an empire that ha plenty of time and is not of   yesterdaynamely according to the principle a slowly a possible   A thinker who ha the future of Europe at heart will in all his   perspective concerning the future calculate upon the Jews a he   will calculate upon the Russians a above all the surest and likeliest   factor in the great play and battle of force That which is at present   called a nation in Europe and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA   indeed sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA is in   every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet   a race much le such a race AERE PERENNUS a the Jews are such   nation should most carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and   hostility It is certain that the Jews if they desiredor if they   were driven to it a the antiSemites seem to wishCOULD now have the   ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over Europe that they are NOT   working and planning for that end is equally certain Meanwhile they   rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and   absorbed by Europe they long to be finally settled authorized and   respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the   wandering Jewand one should certainly take account of this impulse   and tendency and MAKE ADVANCES to it it possibly betokens a mitigation   of the Jewish instinct for which purpose it would perhaps be useful   and fair to banish the antiSemitic bawler out of the country One   should make advance with all prudence and with selection pretty much   a the English nobility do It stand to reason that the more powerful   and strongly marked type of new Germanism could enter into relation   with the Jews with the least hesitation for instance the nobleman   officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many way   to see whether the genius for money and patience and especially some   intellect and intellectualitysadly lacking in the place referred to   could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of   commanding and obeyingfor both of which the country in question ha   now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal   discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my   SERIOUS TOPIC the European problem a I understand it the rearing   of a new ruling caste for Europe     252 They are not a philosophical racethe English Bacon represents an   ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally Hobbes Hume and Locke   an abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more   than a century It wa AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself   it wa Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said JE MEPRISE LOCKE in the   struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world   Hegel and Schopenhauer along with Goethe were of one accord the   two hostile brothergeniuses in philosophy who pushed in different   direction towards the opposite pole of German thought and thereby   wronged each other a only brother will doWhat is lacking in   England and ha always been lacking that halfactor and rhetorician   knew well enough the absurd muddlehead Carlyle who sought to conceal   under passionate grimace what he knew about himself namely what wa   LACKING in Carlylereal POWER of intellect real DEPTH of intellectual   perception in short philosophy It is characteristic of such an   unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianitythey NEED it   discipline for moralizing and humanizing The Englishman more gloomy   sensual headstrong and brutal than the Germanis for that very   reason a the baser of the two also the most pious he ha all the   MORE NEED of Christianity To finer nostril this English Christianity   itself ha still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic   excess for which owing to good reason it is used a an antidotethe   finer poison to neutralize the coarser a finer form of poisoning is   in fact a step in advance with coarsemannered people a step towards   spiritualization The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still   most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime and by praying   and psalmsinging or more correctly it is thereby explained and   differently expressed and for the herd of drunkard and rake who   formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism and   more recently a the Salvation Army a penitential fit may really be   the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can   be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted That however which   offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music to speak   figuratively and also literally he ha neither rhythm nor dance in   the movement of his soul and body indeed not even the desire for   rhythm and dance for music Listen to him speaking look at the most   beautiful Englishwoman WALKINGin no country on earth are there more   beautiful dove and swan finally listen to them singing But I ask   too much     253 There are truth which are best recognized by mediocre mind   because they are best adapted for them there are truth which only   posse charm and seductive power for mediocre spiritsone is pushed   to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence of   respectable but mediocre EnglishmenI may mention Darwin John   Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencerbegins to gain the ascendancy in the   middleclass region of European taste Indeed who could doubt that it   is a useful thing for SUCH mind to have the ascendancy for a time It   would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently   soaring mind a specially qualified for determining and collecting many   little common fact and deducing conclusion from them a exception   they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards   those who are the rule After all they have more to do than merely   to perceivein effect they have to BE something new they have to   SIGNIFY something new they have to REPRESENT new value The gulf   between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more   mysterious than one think the capable man in the grand style the   creator will possibly have to be an ignorant personwhile on the   other hand for scientific discovery like those of Darwin a certain   narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something   English may not be unfavourable for arriving at themFinally let   it not be forgotten that the English with their profound mediocrity   brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence     What is called modern idea or the idea of the eighteenth century   or French ideasthat consequently against which the GERMAN mind   rose up with profound disgustis of English origin there is no doubt   about it The French were only the ape and actor of these idea their   best soldier and likewise ala their first and profoundest VICTIMS   for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of modern idea the AME   FRANCAIS ha in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present   one recall it sixteenth and seventeenth century it profound   passionate strength it inventive excellency almost with disbelief   One must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in   a determined manner and defend it against present prejudice and   appearance the European NOBLESSEof sentiment taste and manner   taking the word in every high senseis the work and invention of   FRANCE the European ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideasis   ENGLANDS work and invention     254 Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual   and refined culture of Europe it is still the high school of taste but   one must know how to find this France of taste He who belongs to it   keep himself well concealedthey may be a small number in whom it   life and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon   the strongest leg in part fatalist hypochondriac invalid in   part person overindulged overrefined such a have the AMBITION to   conceal themselves     They have all something in common they keep their ear closed in   presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic   BOURGEOIS In fact a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawl   in the foregroundit recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste   and at the same time of selfadmiration at the funeral of Victor Hugo   There is also something else common to them a predilection to resist   intellectual Germanizingand a still greater inability to do so   In this France of intellect which is also a France of pessimism   Schopenhauer ha perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than   he ha ever been in Germany not to speak of Heinrich Heine who ha   long ago been reincarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrist   of Paris or of Hegel who at present in the form of Tainethe FIRST   of living historiansexercises an almost tyrannical influence As   regard Richard Wagner however the more French music learns to   adapt itself to the actual need of the AME MODERNE the more will it   Wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehandit is already   taking place sufficiently There are however three thing which the   French can still boast of with pride a their heritage and possession   and a indelible token of their ancient intellectual superiority   in Europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and   vulgarizing of taste FIRSTLY the capacity for artistic emotion for   devotion to form for which the expression LART POUR LART along   with numerous others ha been inventedsuch capacity ha not been   lacking in France for three century and owing to it reverence for   the small number it ha again and again made a sort of chamber   music of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewhere   in EuropeThe SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to   a superiority over Europe is their ancient manysided MORALISTIC   culture owing to which one find on an average even in the petty   ROMANCIERS of the newspaper and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS a   psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example one   ha no conception to say nothing of the thing itself in Germany   The Germans lack a couple of century of the moralistic work requisite   thereto which a we have said France ha not grudged those who call   the Germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect   As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE   PSYCHOLOGICA which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness   of German intercourseand a the most successful expression of   genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate   thrill Henri Beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and   forerunning man who with a Napoleonic TEMPO traversed HIS Europe   in fact several century of the European soul a a surveyor and   discoverer thereofit ha required two generation to OVERTAKE him   one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddle   that perplexed and enraptured himthis strange Epicurean and man of   interrogation the last great psychologist of FranceThere is yet   a THIRD claim to superiority in the French character there is a   successful halfway synthesis of the North and South which make them   comprehend many thing and enjoins upon them other thing which an   Englishman can never comprehend Their temperament turned alternately   to and from the South in which from time to time the Provencal and   Ligurian blood froth over preserve them from the dreadful northern   greyingrey from sunless conceptualspectrism and from poverty of   bloodour GERMAN infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalence   of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high   politics ha with great resolution been prescribed according to   a dangerous healing art which bid me wait and wait but not yet   hopeThere is also still in France a preunderstanding and   ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are too   comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and   know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the   Souththe born Midlanders the good Europeans For them BIZET   ha made music this latest genius who ha seen a new beauty and   seductionwho ha discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC     255 I hold that many precaution should be taken against German music   Suppose a person love the South a I love itas a great school   of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ill a a   boundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereign   existence believing in itselfwell such a person will learn to be   somewhat on his guard against German music because in injuring his   taste anew it will also injure his health anew Such a Southerner a   Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF if he should dream of the future   of music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the   North and must have in his ear the prelude to a deeper mightier and   perhaps more perverse and mysterious music a superGerman music which   doe not fade pale and die away a all German music doe at the   sight of the blue wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of skya   superEuropean music which hold it own even in presence of the brown   sunset of the desert whose soul is akin to the palmtree and can be   at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beast of prey I   could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew   nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some   sailor homesickness some golden shadow and tender weakness might   sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see   the colour of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing   towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to   receive such belated fugitive     256 Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationalitycraze ha   induced and still induces among the nation of Europe owing also to the   shortsighted and hastyhanded politician who with the help of this   craze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent the   disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude   policyowing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable   at present the most unmistakable sign that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE   are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted With all   the more profound and largeminded men of this century the real general   tendency of the mysterious labour of their soul wa to prepare the way   for that new SYNTHESIS and tentatively to anticipate the European of   the future only in their simulation or in their weaker moment in   old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlandsthey only rested   from themselves when they became patriot I think of such men a   Napoleon Goethe Beethoven Stendhal Heinrich Heine Schopenhauer it   must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them about   whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstanding   genius like him have seldom the right to understand themselves   still le of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now   resisted and opposed in France the fact remains nevertheless that   Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forty are   most closely and intimately related to one another They are akin   fundamentally akin in all the height and depth of their requirement   it is Europe the ONE Europe whose soul press urgently and longingly   outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous artwhither   into a new light towards a new sun But who would attempt to express   accurately what all these master of new mode of speech could not   express distinctly It is certain that the same storm and stress   tormented them that they SOUGHT in the same manner these last great   seeker All of

Let the German friend of Richard Wagner advise together a to   whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art or whether   it distinction doe not consist precisely in coming from SUPERGERMAN   source and impulse in which connection it may not be underrated   how indispensable Paris wa to the development of his type which the   strength of his instinct made him long to visit at the most   decisive timeand how the whole style of his proceeding of his   selfapostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the French   socialistic original On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be   found to the honour of Richard Wagners German nature that he ha   acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation   than a nineteenthcentury Frenchman could have doneowing to the   circumstance that we Germans are a yet nearer to barbarism than the   Frenchperhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is   not only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible and   inimitable to the whole latterday Latin race the figure of Siegfried   that VERY FREE man who is probably far too free too hard too   cheerful too healthy too ANTICATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow   civilized nation He may even have been a sin against Romanticism this   antiLatin Siegfried well Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old   sad day

what ye hear is ROMEROMES FAITH BY INTUITION         CHAPTER IX WHAT IS NOBLE       257 EVERY elevation of the type man ha hitherto been the work of an   aristocratic society and so it will always bea society believing in   a long scale of gradation of rank and difference of worth among human   being and requiring slavery in some form or other Without the PATHOS   OF DISTANCE such a grows out of the incarnated difference of class   out of the constant outlooking and downlooking of the ruling caste on   subordinate and instrument and out of their equally constant   practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a   distancethat other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the   longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself   the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more   comprehensive state in short just the elevation of the type man   the continued selfsurmounting of man to use a moral formula in   a supermoral sense To be sure one must not resign oneself to   any humanitarian illusion about the history of the origin of an   aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition for   the elevation of the type man the truth is hard Let u acknowledge   unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto ha ORIGINATED   Men with a still natural nature barbarian in every terrible sense of   the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will   and desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more   peaceful race perhaps trading or cattlerearing community or upon   old mellow civilization in which the final vital force wa flickering   out in brilliant firework of wit and depravity At the commencement   the noble caste wa always the barbarian caste their superiority did   not consist first of all in their physical but in their psychical   powerthey were more COMPLETE men which at every point also implies   the same a more complete beast     258 Corruptionas the indication that anarchy threatens to break out   among the instinct and that the foundation of the emotion called   life is convulsedis something radically different according to   the organization in which it manifest itself When for instance an   aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution   flung away it privilege with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself   to an excess of it moral sentiment it wa corruptionit wa really   only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for century   by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step it   lordly prerogative and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty in   the end even to it decoration and paradedress The essential thing   however in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard   itself a a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but   a the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereofthat it should   therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion   of individual who FOR ITS SAKE must be suppressed and reduced to   imperfect men to slave and instrument Its fundamental belief must   be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for it own sake but   only a a foundation and scaffolding by mean of which a select class   of being may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duty and   in general to a higher EXISTENCE like those sunseeking climbing plant   in Javathey are called Sipo Matadorwhich encircle an oak so   long and so often with their arm until at last high above it but   supported by it they can unfold their top in the open light and   exhibit their happiness     259 To refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitation   and put one will on a par with that of others this may result in a   certain rough sense in good conduct among individual when the necessary   condition are given namely the actual similarity of the individual   in amount of force and degree of worth and their corelation within one   organization As soon however a one wished to take this principle   more generally and if possible even a the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF   SOCIETY it would immediately disclose what it really isnamely a Will   to the DENIAL of life a principle of dissolution and decay Here one   must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental   weakness life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation injury conquest   of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of   peculiar form incorporation and at the least putting it mildest   exploitationbut why should one for ever use precisely these word   on which for age a disparaging purpose ha been stamped Even the   organization within which a wa previously supposed the   individual treat each other a equalit take place in every   healthy aristocracymust itself if it be a living and not a dying   organization do all that towards other body which the individual   within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the   incarnated Will to Power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground   attract to itself and acquire ascendancynot owing to any morality or   immorality but because it LIVES and because life IS precisely Will to   Power On no point however is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans   more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave   everywhere even under the guise of science about coming condition of   society in which the exploiting character is to be absentthat sound   to my ear a if they promised to invent a mode of life which should   refrain from all organic function Exploitation doe not belong to a   depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of   the living being a a primary organic function it is a consequence   of the intrinsic Will to Power which is precisely the Will to   LifeGranting that a a theory this is a noveltyas a reality it is   the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let u be so far honest towards   ourselves     260 In a tour through the many finer and coarser morality which have   hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth I found certain trait   recurring regularly together and connected with one another until   finally two primary type revealed themselves to me and a radical   distinction wa brought to light There is MASTERMORALITY and   SLAVEMORALITYI would at once add however that in all higher and   mixed civilization there are also attempt at the reconciliation of   the two morality but one find still oftener the confusion and   mutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their close   juxtapositioneven in the same man within one soul The distinction   of moral value have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly   conscious of being different from the ruledor among the ruled class   the slave and dependent of all sort In the first case when it is   the ruler who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud   disposition which is regarded a the distinguishing feature and that   which determines the order of rank The noble type of man separate   from himself the being in whom the opposite of this exalted proud   disposition display itself he despises them Let it at once be noted   that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad   mean practically the same a noble and despicablethe antithesis   good and EVIL is of a different origin The cowardly the timid the   insignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised   moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glance the   selfabasing the doglike kind of men who let themselves be abused   the mendicant flatterer and above all the liarsit is a fundamental   belief of all aristocrat that the common people are untruthful We   truthful onesthe nobility in ancient Greece called themselves It is   obvious that everywhere the designation of moral value were at first   applied to MEN and were only derivatively and at a later period applied   to ACTIONS it is a gross mistake therefore when historian of moral   start with question like Why have sympathetic action been praised   The noble type of man regard HIMSELF a a determiner of value he   doe not require to be approved of he pass the judgment What is   injurious to me is injurious in itself he know that it is he himself   only who confers honour on thing he is a CREATOR OF VALUES He   honour whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equal   selfglorification In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude   of power which seek to overflow the happiness of high tension the   consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestowthe noble   man also help the unfortunate but notor scarcelyout of pity but   rather from an impulse generated by the superabundance of power The   noble man honour in himself the powerful one him also who ha power   over himself who know how to speak and how to keep silence who   take pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and ha   reverence for all that is severe and hard Wotan placed a hard heart in   my breast say an old Scandinavian Saga it is thus rightly expressed   from the soul of a proud Viking Such a type of man is even proud of not   being made for sympathy the hero of the Saga therefore add warningly   He who ha not a hard heart when young will never have one The noble   and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality   which see precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of others   or in DESINTERESSEMENT the characteristic of the moral faith   in oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towards   selflessness belong a definitely to noble morality a do a careless   scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heartIt   is the powerful who KNOW how to honour it is their art their domain   for invention The profound reverence for age and for traditionall law   rest on this double reverencethe belief and prejudice in favour of   ancestor and unfavourable to newcomer is typical in the morality of   the powerful and if reversely men of modern idea believe almost   instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more   lacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these idea ha   complacently betrayed itself thereby A morality of the ruling class   however is more especially foreign and irritating to presentday taste   in the sternness of it principle that one ha duty only to one   equal that one may act towards being of a lower rank towards all   that is foreign just a seems good to one or a the heart desire   and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and   similar sentiment can have a place The ability and obligation to   exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revengeboth only within the   circle of equalsartfulness in retaliation RAFFINEMENT of the idea   in friendship a certain necessity to have enemy a outlet for the   emotion of envy quarrelsomeness arrogancein fact in order to be   a good FRIEND all these are typical characteristic of the noble   morality which a ha been pointed out is not the morality of modern   idea and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also to   unearth and discloseIt is otherwise with the second type of morality   SLAVEMORALITY Supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering   the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should   moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimate   Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of   man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with   his situation The slave ha an unfavourable eye for the virtue of the   powerful he ha a skepticism and distrust a REFINEMENT of distrust of   everything good that is there honouredhe would fain persuade himself   that the very happiness there is not genuine On the other hand THOSE   quality which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferer are   brought into prominence and flooded with light it is here that   sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence   humility and friendliness attain to honour for here these are the most   useful quality and almost the only mean of supporting the burden of   existence Slavemorality is essentially the morality of utility   Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and   evilpower and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil   a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of   being despised According to slavemorality therefore the evil man   arouses fear according to mastermorality it is precisely the good   man who arouses fear and seek to arouse it while the bad man is   regarded a the despicable being The contrast attains it maximum when   in accordance with the logical consequence of slavemorality a shade   of depreciationit may be slight and wellintentionedat last attache   itself to the good man of this morality because according to the   servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the SAFE   man he is goodnatured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid un   bonhomme Everywhere that slavemorality gain the ascendancy language   show a tendency to approximate the signification of the word good   and stupidA last fundamental difference the desire for FREEDOM   the instinct for happiness and the refinement of the feeling of liberty   belong a necessarily to slavemorals and morality a artifice and   enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptom of an   aristocratic mode of thinking and estimatingHence we can understand   without further detail why love AS A PASSIONit is our European   specialtymust absolutely be of noble origin a is well known it   invention is due to the Provencal poetcavaliers those brilliant   ingenious men of the gai saber to whom Europe owes so much and   almost owes itself     261 Vanity is one of the thing which are perhaps most difficult for   a noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where another   kind of man think he see it selfevidently The problem for him is   to represent to his mind being who seek to arouse a good opinion of   themselves which they themselves do not possessand consequently also   do not deserveand who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion   afterwards This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so   selfdisrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable   that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful   about it in most case when it is spoken of He will say for   instance I may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand   may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others   precisely a I rate itthat however is not vanity but selfconceit   or in most case that which is called humility and also   modesty Or he will even say For many reason I can delight in   the good opinion of others perhaps because I love and honour them   and rejoice in all their joy perhaps also because their good opinion   endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps   because the good opinion of others even in case where I do not share   it is useful to me or give promise of usefulnessall this however   is not vanity The man of noble character must first bring it home   forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from   time immemorial in all social stratum in any way dependent the ordinary   man WAS only that which he PASSED FORnot being at all accustomed to   fix value he did not assign even to himself any other value than that   which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to   create value It may be looked upon a the result of an extraordinary   atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always WAITING   for an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself   to it yet by no mean only to a good opinion but also to a bad   and unjust one think for instance of the greater part of the   selfappreciations and selfdepreciations which believing woman learn   from their confessor and which in general the believing Christian   learns from his Church In fact conformably to the slow rise of the   democratic social order and it cause the blending of the blood   of master and slave the originally noble and rare impulse of   the master to assign a value to themselves and to think well of   themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but   it ha at all time an older ampler and more radically ingrained   propensity opposed to itand in the phenomenon of vanity this older   propensity overmasters the younger The vain person rejoices over EVERY   good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point   of view of it usefulness and equally regardless of it truth or   falsehood just a he suffers from every bad opinion for he subject   himself to both he feel himself subjected to both by that oldest   instinct of subjection which break forth in himIt is the slave   in the vain man blood the remains of the slave craftinessand how   much of the slave is still left in woman for instancewhich   seek to SEDUCE to good opinion of itself it is the slave too who   immediately afterwards fall prostrate himself before these opinion a   though he had not called them forthAnd to repeat it again vanity is   an atavism     262 A SPECIES originates and a type becomes established and strong in   the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE condition On   the other hand it is known by the experience of breeder that specie   which receive superabundant nourishment and in general a surplus of   protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop   variation and are fertile in prodigy and monstrosity also in   monstrous vice Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say   an ancient Greek polis or Venice a a voluntary or involuntary   contrivance for the purpose of REARING human being there are there men   beside one another thrown upon their own resource who want to make   their specie prevail chiefly because they MUST prevail or else   run the terrible danger of being exterminated The favour the   superabundance the protection are there lacking under which variation   are fostered the specie need itself a specie a something which   precisely by virtue of it hardness it uniformity and simplicity of   structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in   constant struggle with it neighbour or with rebellious or   rebellionthreatening vassal The most varied experience teach it   what are the quality to which it principally owes the fact that   it still exists in spite of all Gods and men and ha hitherto been   victorious these quality it call virtue and these virtue alone   it develops to maturity It doe so with severity indeed it desire   severity every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education   of youth in the control of woman in the marriage custom in the   relation of old and young in the penal law which have an eye only   for the degenerating it count intolerance itself among the virtue   under the name of justice A type with few but very marked feature   a specie of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent   men and a such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and   nuance of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitude   of generation the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE   condition is a already remarked the cause of a type becoming   stable and hard Finally however a happy state of thing result the   enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps no more enemy among the   neighbouring people and the mean of life even of the enjoyment   of life are present in superabundance With one stroke the bond and   constraint of the old discipline severs it is no longer regarded a   necessary a a condition of existenceif it would continue it can   only do so a a form of LUXURY a an archaizing TASTE Variations   whether they be deviation into the higher finer and rarer or   deterioration and monstrosity appear suddenly on the scene in the   greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dare to be individual   and detach himself At this turningpoint of history there manifest   themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a   magnificent manifold virginforestlike upgrowth and upstriving a   kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary   decay and selfdestruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly   exploding egoism which strive with one another for sun and light   and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for   themselves by mean of the hitherto existing morality It wa this   morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bent   the bow in so threatening a mannerit is now out of date it is   getting out of date The dangerous and disquieting point ha been   reached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life IS   LIVED BEYOND the old morality the individual stand out and is   obliged to have recourse to his own lawgiving his own art and   artifice for selfpreservation selfelevation and selfdeliverance   Nothing but new Why s nothing but new How s no common formula any   longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay   deterioration and the loftiest desire frightfully entangled the   genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopia of good and bad   a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn full of new charm   and mystery peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied   corruption Danger is again present the mother of morality great   danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and   friend into the street into their own child into their own heart   into all the most personal and secret recess of their desire and   volition What will the moral philosopher who appear at this time have   to preach They discover these sharp onlooker and loafer that the   end is quickly approaching that everything around them decay and   produce decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow   except one specie of man the incurably MEDIOCRE The mediocre alone   have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselvesthey will   be the men of the future the sole survivor be like them become   mediocre is now the only morality which ha still a significance   which still obtains a hearingBut it is difficult to preach this   morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it   desire it ha to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly   loveit will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY     263 There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK which more than anything else is   already the sign of a HIGH rank there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES   of reverence which lead one to infer noble origin and habit The   refinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test   when something pass by that is of the highest rank but is not   yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touch and   incivility something that go it way like a living touchstone   undistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiled   and disguised He whose task and practice it is to investigate soul   will avail himself of many variety of this very art to determine the   ultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to which   it belongs he will test it by it INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE DIFFERENCE   ENGENDRE HAINE the vulgarity of many a nature spurt up suddenly like   dirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrine any   book bearing the mark of great destiny is brought before it while   on the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of the   eye a cessation of all gesture by which it is indicated that a soul   FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect The way in which on   the whole the reverence for the BIBLE ha hitherto been maintained   in Europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of   manner which Europe owes to Christianity book of such profoundness   and supreme significance require for their protection an external   tyranny of authority in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousand of   year which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them Much ha been   achieved when the sentiment ha been at last instilled into the mass   the shallowpates and the booby of every kind that they are not   allowed to touch everything that there are holy experience before   which they must take off their shoe and keep away the unclean handit   is almost their highest advance towards humanity On the contrary in   the socalled cultured class the believer in modern idea nothing   is perhaps so repulsive a their lack of shame the easy insolence of   eye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything and it   is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste and   more tact for reverence among the people among the lower class of   the people especially among peasant than among the newspaperreading   DEMIMONDE of intellect the cultured class     264 It can not be effaced from a man soul what his ancestor have   preferably and most constantly done whether they were perhaps diligent   economizer attached to a desk and a cashbox modest and citizenlike   in their desire modest also in their virtue or whether they were   accustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasure   and probably of still ruder duty and responsibility or whether   finally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privilege of   birth and possession in order to live wholly for their faithfor their   Godas men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blush   at every compromise It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have   the quality and predilection of his parent and ancestor in his   constitution whatever appearance may suggest to the contrary This is   the problem of race Granted that one know something of the parent   it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child any kind   of offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsy   selfvauntingthe three thing which together have constituted the   genuine plebeian type in all timessuch must pas over to the child a   surely a bad blood and with the help of the best education and culture   one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredityAnd   what else doe education and culture try to do nowadays In our very   democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture MUST   be essentially the art of deceivingdeceiving with regard to origin   with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul An educator   who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called out   constantly to his pupil Be true Be natural Show yourselves a you   areeven such a virtuous and sincere as would learn in a short time   to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace NATURAM EXPELLERE with what   result Plebeianism USQUE RECURRET FOOTNOTE Horaces Epistles   I x 24     265 At the risk of displeasing innocent ear I submit that egoism   belongs to the essence of a noble soul I mean the unalterable belief   that to a being such a we other being must naturally be in   subjection and have to sacrifice themselves The noble soul accepts the   fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of   harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather a something   that may have it basis in the primary law of thingsif he sought a   designation for it he would say It is justice itself He acknowledges   under certain circumstance which made him hesitate at first that   there are other equally privileged one a soon a he ha settled this   question of rank he move among those equal and equally privileged   one with the same assurance a regard modesty and delicate respect   which he enjoys in intercourse with himselfin accordance with an   innate heavenly mechanism which all the star understand It is an   ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism this artfulness and selflimitation   in intercourse with his equalsevery star is a similar egoist he   honour HIMSELF in them and in the right which he concedes to them he   ha no doubt that the exchange of honour and right a the ESSENCE of   all intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of thing The   noble soul give a he take prompted by the passionate and sensitive   instinct of requital which is at the root of his nature The notion of   favour ha INTER PARES neither significance nor good repute there   may be a sublime way of letting gift a it were light upon one from   above and of drinking them thirstily like dewdrop but for those   art and display the noble soul ha no aptitude His egoism hinders him   here in general he look aloft unwillinglyhe look either FORWARD   horizontally and deliberately or downwardsHE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A   HEIGHT     266 One can only truly esteem him who doe not LOOK OUT FOR   himselfGoethe to Rath Schlosser     267 The Chinese have a proverb which mother even teach their child   SIAOSIN MAKE THY HEART SMALL This is the essentially fundamental   tendency in latterday civilization I have no doubt that an ancient   Greek also would first of all remark the selfdwarfing in u Europeans   of todayin this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful   to him     268 What after all is ignoblenessWords are vocal symbol for   idea idea however are more or le definite mental symbol   for frequently returning and concurring sensation for group of   sensation It is not sufficient to use the same word in order to   understand one another we must also employ the same word for the same   kind of internal experience we must in the end have experience IN   COMMON On this account the people of one nation understand one another   better than those belonging to different nation even when they use   the same language or rather when people have lived long together under   similar condition of climate soil danger requirement toil

rarely about   these matter people understand one another rapidly and always more   rapidlythe history of language is the history of a process of   abbreviation on the basis of this quick comprehension people always   unite closer and closer The greater the danger the greater is the   need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to   misunderstand one another in dangerthat is what can not at all be   dispensed with in intercourse Also in all love and friendship one ha   the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery   ha been made that in using the same word one of the two party ha   feeling thought intuition wish or fear different from those of   the other The fear of the eternal misunderstanding that is the good   genius which so often keep person of different sex from too   hasty attachment to which sense and heart prompt themand NOT some   Schopenhauerian genius of the specie Whichever group of sensation   within a soul

similar requirement and similar experience by similar symbol   it result on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need   which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON

more a psychologista born an unavoidable psychologist   and souldivinerturns his attention to the more select case and   individual the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy   he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man For   the corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusually   constituted soul is in fact the rule it is dreadful to have such a   rule always before one eye The manifold torment of the psychologist   who ha discovered this ruination who discovers once and then   discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history this universal   inner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late in every   sensemay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with   bitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt at   selfdestructionof his going to ruin himself One may perceive   in almost every psychologist a telltale inclination for delightful   intercourse with commonplace and wellordered men the fact is thereby   disclosed that he always requires healing that he need a sort   of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight and   incisivenessfrom what his businesshas laid upon his conscience   The fear of his memory is peculiar to him He is easily silenced by the   judgment of others he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour   admire love and glorify where he ha PERCEIVEDor he even conceals   his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion Perhaps   the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that precisely   where he ha learnt GREAT SYMPATHY together with great CONTEMPT the   multitude the educated and the visionary have on their part learnt   great reverencereverence for great men and marvelous animal for   the sake of whom one blesses and honour the fatherland the earth the   dignity of mankind and one own self to whom one point the young   and in view of whom one educates them And who know but in all great   instance hitherto just the same happened that the multitude worshipped   a God and that the God wa only a poor sacrificial animal SUCCESS   ha always been the greatest liarand the work itself is a success   the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised in   their creation until they are unrecognizable the work of the artist   of the philosopher only invents him who ha created it is REPUTED   to have created it the great men a they are reverenced are poor   little fiction composed afterwards in the world of historical value   spurious coinage PREVAILS Those great poet for example such a   Byron Musset Poe Leopardi Kleist Gogol I do not venture to mention   much greater name but I have them in my mind a they now appear and   were perhaps obliged to be men of the moment enthusiastic sensuous   and childish lightminded and impulsive in their trust and distrust   with soul in which usually some flaw ha to be concealed often taking   revenge with their work for an internal defilement often seeking   forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost in   the mud and almost in love with it until they become like the   WillotheWisps around the swamp and PRETEND TO BE starsthe people   then call them idealistsoften struggling with protracted disgust   with an everreappearing phantom of disbelief which make them cold   and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour faith a it is   out of the hand of intoxicated adulatorswhat a TORMENT these great   artist are and the socalled higher men in general to him who ha once   found them out It is thus conceivable that it is just from womanwho   is clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eager   to help and save to an extent far beyond her powersthat THEY have   learnt so readily those outbreak of boundless devoted SYMPATHY which   the multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understand   and overwhelm with prying and selfgratifying interpretation This   sympathizing invariably deceives itself a to it power woman would   like to believe that love can do EVERYTHINGit is the SUPERSTITION   peculiar to her Alas he who know the heart find out how poor   helpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest love   ishe find that it rather DESTROYS than savesIt is possible that   under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden   one of the most painful case of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE   the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart that   never had enough of any human love that DEMANDED love that demanded   inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terrible   outburst against those who refused him their love the story of a poor   soul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to send   thither those who WOULD NOT love himand that at last enlightened   about human love had to invent a God who is entire love entire   CAPACITY for lovewho take pity on human love because it is so   paltry so ignorant He who ha such sentiment he who ha such   KNOWLEDGE about loveSEEKS for deathBut why should one deal with   such painful matter Provided of course that one is not obliged to do   so     270 The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who ha   suffered deeplyit almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men   can sufferthe chilling certainty with

the most refined form of disguise is Epicurism   along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which take   suffering lightly and put itself on the defensive against all that   is sorrowful and profound They are gay men who make use of gaiety   because they are misunderstood on account of itthey WISH to be   misunderstood There are scientific mind who make use of science   because it give a gay appearance and because scientificness lead to   the conclusion that a person is superficialthey WISH to mislead to a   false conclusion There are free insolent mind which would fain conceal   and deny that they are broken proud incurable heart the cynicism of   Hamletthe case of Galiani and occasionally folly itself is the mask   of an unfortunate OVERASSURED knowledgeFrom which it follows that it   is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask   and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place     271 That which separate two men most profoundly is a different sense   and grade of purity What doe it matter about all their honesty and   reciprocal usefulness what doe it matter about all their mutual   goodwill the fact still remainsthey can not smell each other The   highest instinct for purity place him who is affected with it in the   most extraordinary and dangerous isolation a a saint for it is just   holinessthe highest spiritualization of the instinct in question Any   kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath   any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out   of night

him and in the foregroundand thereby   betrays himself     276 In all kind of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is   better off than the nobler soul the danger of the latter must be   greater

believe it of me But I insist that they believe it   of me I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about   myself only in very rare case only compulsorily always without   delight in the subject ready to digress from myself and always   without faith in the result owing to an unconquerable distrust of the   POSSIBILITY of selfknowledge which ha led me so far a to feel a   CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of direct knowledge which   theorist allow themselvesthis matter of fact is almost the most   certain thing I know about myself There must be a sort of repugnance   in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myselfIs there perhaps   some enigma therein Probably but fortunately nothing for my own   teethPerhaps it betrays the specie to which I belongbut

the   same time a noble selfcontrol to praise only where one DOES NOT   agreeotherwise in fact one would praise oneself which is contrary   to good tastea selfcontrol to be sure which offer excellent   opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING To be able to   allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one must   not live among intellectual imbecile but rather among men

word noble still mean for u   nowadays How doe the noble man betray himself how is he recognized   under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by which   everything is rendered opaque and leadenIt is not his action which   establish his claimactions are always ambiguous always inscrutable   neither is it his work One find nowadays among artist and scholar   plenty of those who betray by their work that a profound longing for   nobleness impels them but this very NEED of nobleness is radically   different from the need of the noble soul itself and is in fact the   eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof It is not the work   but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of   rankto employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper   meaningit is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul ha about   itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and   perhaps also is not to be lostTHE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR   ITSELF     288 There are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn   and twist themselves a they will and hold their hand before their   treacherous eyesas though the hand were not a

obliged to know it VERTU   EST ENTHOUSIASME     289 In the writing of a recluse one always hears something of the echo   of the wilderness something of the murmuring tone and timid vigilance   of solitude in his strongest word even in his cry itself there   sound a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment He who   ha sat day and night from year end to year end alone with his   soul in familiar discord and discourse he who ha become a cavebear   or a treasureseeker or a treasureguardian and dragon in his caveit   may be a labyrinth but can also be a goldminehis idea themselves   eventually acquire a twilightcolour of their own and an odour a much   of the depth a of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive   which blow chilly upon every passerby The recluse doe not believe   that a philosophersupposing that a philosopher ha always in the first   place been a recluseever expressed his actual and ultimate opinion in   book are not book written precisely to hide what is in usindeed   he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have ultimate and actual   opinion at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must   necessarily be a still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer   world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every   foundation Every philosophy is a foreground philosophythis is a   recluse verdict There is something arbitrary in the fact that the   PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around   that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeperthere   is also something suspicious in it Every philosophy also CONCEALS a   philosophy every opinion is also a LURKINGPLACE every word is also a   MASK     290 Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being   misunderstood The latter perhaps wound his vanity but the former   wound his heart his sympathy which always say Ah why would you   also have a hard a time of it a I have     291 Man a COMPLEX mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny   to the other animal by his artifice and sagacity rather than by his   strength ha invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his   soul a something SIMPLE and the whole of morality is a long audacious   falsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of   the soul becomes possible From this point of view there is perhaps much   more in the conception of art than is generally believed     292 A philosopher that is a man who constantly experience see   hears suspect hope and dream extraordinary thing who is struck   by his own thought a if they came from the outside from above and   below a a specie of event and lightningflashes PECULIAR TO HIM who   is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightning a portentous   man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and   something uncanny going on A philosopher ala a being who often   run away from himself is often afraid of himselfbut whose curiosity   always make him come to himself again     293 A man who say I like that I take it for my own and mean to   guard and protect it from every one a man who can conduct a case   carry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a woman   punish and overthrow insolence a man who ha his indignation and his   sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the   animal willingly submit and naturally belong in short a man who is a   MASTER by naturewhen such a man ha sympathy well THAT sympathy ha   value But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer Or of   those even who preach sympathy There is nowadays throughout almost the   whole of Europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain   and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing   which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seek   to deck itself out a something superiorthere is a regular cult of   suffering The UNMANLINESS of that which is called sympathy by such   group of visionary is always I believe the first thing that   strike the eyeOne must resolutely and radically taboo this latest   form of bad taste and finally I wish people to put the good amulet   GAI SABER gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck a   a protection against it     294 THE OLYMPIAN VICEDespite the philosopher who a a genuine   Englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking   mindsLaughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which every   thinking mind will strive to overcome HobbesI would even   allow myself to rank philosopher according to the quality of their   laughingup to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter And supposing   that Gods also philosophize which I am strongly inclined to believe   owing to many reasonsI have no doubt that they also know how to laugh   thereby in an overmanlike and new fashionand at the expense of all   serious thing Gods are fond of ridicule it seems that they can not   refrain from laughter even in holy matter     295 The genius of the heart a that great mysterious one posse   it the temptergod and born ratcatcher of conscience whose voice can   descend into the netherworld of every soul who neither speaks a word   nor cast a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch   of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he know how to   appearnot a he is but in a guise which act a an ADDITIONAL   constraint on his follower to press ever closer to him to follow him   more cordially and thoroughlythe genius of the heart which imposes   silence and attention on everything loud and selfconceited which   smoothes rough soul and make them taste a new longingto lie placid   a a mirror that the deep heaven may be reflected in themthe genius   of the heart which teach the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate   and to grasp more delicately which scent the hidden and forgotten   treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark   ice and is a diviningrod for every grain of gold long buried and   imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with   which every one go away richer not favoured or surprised not a   though gratified and oppressed by the good thing of others but richer   in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a   thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more   bruised but full of hope which a yet lack name full of a new will   and current full of a new illwill and countercurrent but what am I   doing my friend Of whom am I talking to you Have I forgotten myself   so far that I have not even told you his name Unless it be that you   have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God   and spirit is that wish to be PRAISED in such a manner For a it   happens to every one who from childhood onward ha always been on his   leg and in foreign land I have also encountered on my path many   strange and dangerous spirit above all however and again and again   the one of whom I have just spoken in fact no le a personage than   the God DIONYSUS the great equivocator and tempter to whom a you   know I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my firstfruitsthe   last a it seems to me who ha offered a SACRIFICE to him for I   have found no one who could understand what I wa then doing In   the meantime however I have learned much far too much about the   philosophy of this God and a I said from mouth to mouthI the last   disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus and perhaps I might at last   begin to give you my friend a far a I am allowed a little taste of   this philosophy In a hushed voice a is but seemly for it ha to do   with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny The   very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore Gods also   philosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and might   perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophersamong you my   friend there is le to be said against it except that it come too   late and not at the right time for a it ha been disclosed to me you   are loth nowadays to believe in God and god It may happen too that   in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the   strict usage of your ear Certainly the God in question went further   very much further in such dialogue and wa always many pace ahead of   me Indeed if it were allowed I should have to give him according   to human usage fine ceremonious tide of lustre and merit I should   have to extol his courage a investigator and discoverer his fearless   honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom But such a God doe not know   what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp Keep that he   would say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else require   it Ihave no reason to cover my nakedness One suspect that this   kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lack shameHe once said   Under certain circumstance I love mankindand referred thereby to   Ariadne who wa present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave   inventive animal that ha not his equal upon earth he make his way   even through all labyrinth I like man and often think how I can   still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more   profoundStronger more evil and more profound I asked in horror   Yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more   beautifuland thereby the temptergod smiled with his halcyon smile   a though he had just paid some charming compliment One here see at   once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacksand in general   there are good ground for supposing that in some thing the Gods could   all of them come to u men for instruction We men aremore human     296 Alas what are you after all my written and painted thought Not   long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorn   and secret spice that you made me sneeze and laughand now You   have already doffed your novelty and some of you I fear are ready   to become truth so immortal do they look so pathetically honest so   tedious And wa it ever otherwise What then do we write and paint   we mandarin with Chinese brush we immortalisers of thing which LEND   themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting Alas only   that which is just about to fade and begin to lose it odour Alas   only exhausted and departing storm and belated yellow sentiment Alas   only bird strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves be   captured with the handwith OUR hand We immortalize what can not live   and fly much longer thing only which are exhausted and mellow And it   is only for your AFTERNOON you my written and painted thought for   which alone I have colour many colour perhaps many variegated   softening and fifty yellow and brown and green and redsbut   nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning you sudden   spark and

been   dogmatist have failed to understand womenthat the terrible   seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid   their address to Truth have been unskilled and unseemly method for   winning a woman Certainly she ha never allowed herself to be won and   at present every kind of dogma stand with sad and discouraged mienIF   indeed it stand at all For there are scoffer who maintain that it   ha fallen that all dogma lie on the groundnay more that it is at   it last gasp But to speak seriously there are good ground for hoping   that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive   and decided air it ha assumed may have been only a noble puerilism   and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once   and again understood WHAT ha actually sufficed for the basis of such   imposing and absolute philosophical edifice a the dogmatist have   hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time   such a the soulsuperstition which in the form of subject and   egosuperstition ha not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some   play upon word a deception on the part of grammar or an   audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very   humanalltoohuman fact The philosophy of the dogmatist it is to   be hoped wa only a promise for thousand of year afterwards a wa   astrology in still earlier time in the service of which probably more   labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any   actual science hitherto we owe to it and to it superterrestrial   pretension in Asia and Egypt the grand style of architecture It seems   that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with   everlasting claim all great thing have first to wander about the   earth a enormous and aweinspiring caricature dogmatic philosophy ha   been a caricature of this kindfor instance the Vedanta doctrine in   Asia and Platonism in Europe Let u not be ungrateful to it although   it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome   and the most dangerous of error hitherto ha been a dogmatist   errornamely Platos invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself   But now when it ha been surmounted when Europe rid of this nightmare   can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthiersleep   we WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF are the heir of all the strength   which the struggle against this error ha fostered It amounted to   the very inversion of truth and the denial of the PERSPECTIVEthe   fundamental conditionof life to speak of Spirit and the Good a Plato   spoke of them indeed one might ask a a physician How did such a   malady attack that finest product of antiquity Plato Had the wicked   Socrates really corrupted him Was Socrates after all a corrupter of   youth and deserved his hemlock But the struggle against Plato   orto speak plainer and for the peoplethe struggle against   the ecclesiastical oppression of millennium of Christianity FOR   CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE PEOPLE produced in Europe   a magnificent tension of soul such a had not existed anywhere   previously with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the   furthest goal As a matter of fact the European feel this tension a   a state of distress and twice attempt have been made in grand style to   unbend the bow once by mean of Jesuitism and the second time by mean   of democratic enlightenmentwhich with the aid of liberty of the press   and newspaperreading might in fact bring it about that the spirit   would not so easily find itself in distress The Germans invented   gunpowderall credit to them but they again made thing squarethey   invented printing But we who are neither Jesuits nor democrat   nor even sufficiently Germans we GOOD EUROPEANS and free VERY free   spiritswe have it still all the distress of spirit and all the   tension of it bow And perhaps also the arrow the duty and who   know THE GOAL TO AIM AT     Sils Maria Upper Engadine JUNE 1885           CHAPTER I PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS       1 The Will to Truth which is to tempt u to many a hazardous   enterprise the famous Truthfulness of which all philosopher have   hitherto spoken with respect what question ha this Will to Truth not   laid before u What strange perplexing questionable question It is   already a long story yet it seems a if it were hardly commenced Is   it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn   impatiently away That this Sphinx teach u at last to ask question   ourselves WHO is it really that put question to u here WHAT really   is this Will to Truth in u In fact we made a long halt at the   question a to the origin of this Willuntil at last we came to an   absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question We inquired   about the VALUE of this Will Granted that we want the truth WHY NOT   RATHER untruth And uncertainty Even ignorance The problem of the   value of truth presented itself before usor wa it we who presented   ourselves before the problem Which of u is the Oedipus here Which   the Sphinx It would seem to be a rendezvous of question and note of   interrogation And could it be believed that it at last seems to u a   if the problem had never been propounded before a if we were the first   to discern it get a sight of it and RISK RAISING it For there is risk   in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk     2 HOW COULD anything originate out of it opposite For example truth   out of error or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception or the   generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sunbright vision of the   wise man out of covetousness Such genesis is impossible whoever dream   of it is a fool nay worse than a fool thing of the highest   value must have a different origin an origin of THEIR ownin this   transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of   delusion and cupidity they can not have their source But rather in   the lap of Being in the intransitory in the concealed God in the   ThinginitselfTHERE must be their source and nowhere elseThis   mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which   metaphysicians of all time can be recognized this mode of valuation   is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of   theirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that   is in the end solemnly christened the Truth The fundamental belief of   metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES It never occurred   even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where   doubt however wa most necessary though they had made a solemn   vow DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM For it may be doubted firstly whether   antithesis exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuation   and antithesis of value upon which metaphysicians have set their   seal are not perhaps merely superficial estimate merely provisional   perspective besides being probably made from some corner perhaps from   belowfrog perspective a it were to borrow an expression current   among painter In spite of all the value which may belong to the true   the positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higher   and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to   pretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity It   might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and   respected thing consists precisely in their being insidiously   related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed   thingsperhaps even in being essentially identical with them Perhaps   But who wish to concern himself with such dangerous Perhapses   For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of   philosopher such a will have other taste and inclination the   reverse of those hitherto prevalentphilosophers of the dangerous   Perhaps in every sense of the term And to speak in all seriousness I   see such new philosopher beginning to appear     3 Having kept a sharp eye on philosopher and having read between   their line long enough I now say to myself that the greater part of   conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive function and   it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one ha here to   learn anew a one learned anew about heredity and innateness As   little a the act of birth come into consideration in the whole process   and procedure of heredity just a little is beingconscious OPPOSED   to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the   conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his   instinct and forced into definite channel And behind all logic and   it seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuation or to speak   more plainly physiological demand for the maintenance of a definite   mode of life For example that the certain is worth more than the   uncertain that illusion is le valuable than truth such valuation   in spite of their regulative importance for US might notwithstanding be   only superficial valuation special kind of niaiserie such a may   be necessary for the maintenance of being such a ourselves Supposing   in effect that man is not just the measure of thing     4 The falseness of an opinion is not for u any objection to it it is   here perhaps that our new language sound most strangely The   question is how far an opinion is lifefurthering lifepreserving   speciespreserving perhaps speciesrearing and we are fundamentally   inclined to maintain that the falsest opinion to which the synthetic   judgment a priori belong are the most indispensable to u that   without a recognition of logical fiction without a comparison of   reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable   without a constant counterfeiting of the world by mean of number   man could not livethat the renunciation of false opinion would be   a renunciation of life a negation of life TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A   CONDITION OF LIFE that is certainly to impugn the traditional idea of   value in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which venture to do so   ha thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil     5 That which cause philosopher to be regarded halfdistrustfully   and halfmockingly is not the oftrepeated discovery how innocent they   arehow often and easily they make mistake and lose their way in   short how childish and childlike they arebut that there is not   enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud and   virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in   the remotest manner They all pose a though their real opinion had   been discovered and attained through the selfevolving of a cold pure   divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sort of mystic   who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact a   prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally   their heart desire abstracted and refined is defended by them with   argument sought out after the event They are all advocate who do not   wish to be regarded a such generally astute defender also of their   prejudice which they dub truthsand VERY far from having the   conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having   the good taste of the courage which go so far a to let this be   understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidence   and selfridicule The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant equally   stiff and decent with which he entices u into the dialectic   byway that lead more correctly mislead to his categorical   imperativemakes u fastidious one smile we who find no small   amusement in spying out the subtle trick of old moralist and ethical   preacher Or still more so the hocuspocus in mathematical form by   mean of which Spinoza ha a it were clad his philosophy in mail and   maskin fact the love of HIS wisdom to translate the term fairly   and squarelyin order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart   of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible   maiden that Pallas Athenehow much of personal timidity and   vulnerability doe this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray     6 It ha gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up   till now ha consisted ofnamely the confession of it originator and   a specie of involuntary and unconscious autobiography and moreover   that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy ha constituted   the true vital germ out of which the entire plant ha always grown   Indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertion of a   philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to first   ask oneself What morality do they or doe he aim at Accordingly   I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of   philosophy but that another impulse here a elsewhere ha only made   use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge a an instrument But whoever   considers the fundamental impulse of man with a view to determining   how far they may have here acted a INSPIRING GENII or a demon and   cobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time   or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to   look upon itself a the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate   LORD over all the other impulse For every impulse is imperious and a   SUCH attempt to philosophize To be sure in the case of scholar in   the case of really scientific men it may be otherwisebetter if   you will there there may really be such a thing a an impulse to   knowledge some kind of small independent clockwork which when well   wound up work away industriously to that end WITHOUT the rest of   the scholarly impulse taking any material part therein The actual   interest of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another   directionin the family perhaps or in moneymaking or in politics   it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little   machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a   good philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist he is not   CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that In the philosopher on the   contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all   his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony a to WHO HE   ISthat is to say in what order the deepest impulse of his nature   stand to each other     7 How malicious philosopher can be I know of nothing more stinging   than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the   Platonists he called them Dionysiokolakes In it original sense   and on the face of it the word signifies Flatterers of   Dionysiusconsequently tyrant accessory and lickspittles   besides this however it is a much a to say They are all ACTORS   there is nothing genuine about them for Dionysiokolax wa a popular   name for an actor And the latter is really the malignant reproach that   Epicurus cast upon Plato he wa annoyed by the grandiose manner the   mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholar were mastersof   which Epicurus wa not a master He the old schoolteacher of Samos   who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens and wrote three   hundred book perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato who   know Greece took a hundred year to find out who the gardengod   Epicurus really wa Did she ever find out     8 There is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of   the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the word of an   ancient mystery     Adventavit asinus Pulcher et fortissimus     9 You desire to LIVE according to Nature Oh you noble Stoics what   fraud of word Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature boundlessly   extravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or consideration   without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain   imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE a a powerhow COULD you live   in accordance with such indifference To liveis not that just   endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature Is not living valuing   preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different   And granted that your imperative living according to Nature mean   actually the same a living according to lifehow could you do   DIFFERENTLY Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves   are and must be In reality however it is quite otherwise with you   while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature   you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stageplayers   and selfdeluders In your pride you wish to dictate your moral and   ideal to Nature to Nature herself and to incorporate them therein   you insist that it shall be Nature according to the Stoa and would   like everything to be made after your own image a a vast eternal   glorification and generalism of Stoicism With all your love for truth   you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such   hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY that is to say Stoically   that you are no longer able to see it otherwiseand to crown all some   unfathomable superciliousness give you the Bedlamite hope that   BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselvesStoicism is   selftyrannyNature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is   not the Stoic a PART of Nature But this is an old and everlasting   story what happened in old time with the Stoics still happens today   a soon a ever a philosophy begin to believe in itself It always   creates the world in it own image it can not do otherwise philosophy   is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual Will to Power the   will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima     10 The eagerness and subtlety I should even say craftiness with   which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at   present throughout Europe furnishes food for thought and attention and   he who hears only a Will to Truth in the background and nothing else   can not certainly boast of the sharpest ear In rare and isolated   case it may really have happened that such a Will to Trutha certain   extravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of the   forlorn hopehas participated therein that which in the end always   prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful   possibility there may even be puritanical fanatic of conscience   who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in an   uncertain something But that is Nihilism and the sign of a despairing   mortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a   virtue may display It seems however to be otherwise with stronger   and livelier thinker who are still eager for life In that they side   AGAINST appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in   that they rank the credibility of their own body about a low a the   credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stand still and   thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession   to escape for what doe one at present believe in more firmly than   in one bodywho know if they are not really trying to win back   something which wa formerly an even securer possession something   of the old domain of the faith of former time perhaps the immortal   soul perhaps the old God in short idea by which they could live   better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by   modern idea There is DISTRUST of these modern idea in this mode   of looking at thing a disbelief in all that ha been constructed   yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety   and scorn which can no longer endure the BRICABRAC of idea of the   most varied origin such a socalled Positivism at present throw on   the market a disgust of the more refined taste at the villagefair   motleyness and patchiness of all these realityphilosophasters in whom   there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness Therein it   seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical antirealists and   knowledgemicroscopists of the present day their instinct which repels   them from MODERN reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde   bypath concern u The main thing about them is NOT that they wish   to go back but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom A little MORE   strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be OFFand   not back     11 It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to   divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on   German philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which   he set upon himself Kant wa first and foremost proud of his Table of   Categories with it in his hand he said This is the most difficult   thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics Let u   only understand this could be He wa proud of having DISCOVERED a   new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori Granting   that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid   flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and   on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible   somethingat all event new facultiesof which to be still   prouderBut let u reflect for a momentit is high time to do so   How are synthetic judgment a priori POSSIBLE Kant asks himselfand   what is really his answer BY MEANS OF A MEANS facultybut   unfortunately not in five word but so circumstantially imposingly   and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourish that   one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved   in such an answer People were beside themselves with delight over this   new faculty and the jubilation reached it climax when Kant further   discovered a moral faculty in manfor at that time Germans were still   moral not yet dabbling in the Politics of hard fact Then came   the honeymoon of German philosophy All the young theologian of the   Tubingen institution went immediately into the grovesall seeking for   faculty And what did they not findin that innocent rich and   still youthful period of the German spirit to which Romanticism the   malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish   between finding and inventing Above all a faculty for the   transcendental Schelling christened it intellectual intuition   and thereby gratified the most earnest longing of the naturally   piousinclined Germans One can do no greater wrong to the whole of   this exuberant and eccentric movement which wa really youthfulness   notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile   conception than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral   indignation Enough howeverthe world grew older and the dream   vanished A time came when people rubbed their forehead and they still   rub them today People had been dreaming and first and foremostold   Kant By mean of a mean facultyhe had said or at least meant to   say But is thatan answer An explanation Or is it not rather merely   a repetition of the question How doe opium induce sleep By mean of   a mean faculty namely the virtu dormitiva reply the doctor in   Moliere         Quia est in eo virtu dormitiva       Cujus est natura sensus assoupire     But such reply belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time   to replace the Kantian question How are synthetic judgment a PRIORI   possible by another question Why is belief in such judgment   necessaryin effect it is high time that we should understand   that such judgment must be believed to be true for the sake of the   preservation of creature like ourselves though they still might   naturally be false judgment Or more plainly spoken and roughly and   readilysynthetic judgment a priori should not be possible at all   we have no right to them in our mouth they are nothing but false   judgment Only of course the belief in their truth is necessary a   plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view   of life And finally to call to mind the enormous influence which   German philosophyI hope you understand it right to inverted comma   goosefeethas exercised throughout the whole of Europe there is   no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it thanks to   German philosophy it wa a delight to the noble idler the virtuous   the mystic the artiste the threefourths Christians and the   political obscurantist of all nation to find an antidote to the still   overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into   this in shortsensus assoupire     12 As regard materialistic atomism it is one of the bestrefuted   theory that have been advanced and in Europe there is now perhaps   no one in the learned world so unscholarly a to attach serious   signification to it except for convenient everyday use a an   abbreviation of the mean of expressionthanks chiefly to the Pole   Boscovich he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest   and most successful opponent of ocular evidence For while Copernicus   ha persuaded u to believe contrary to all the sens that the earth   doe NOT stand fast Boscovich ha taught u to abjure the belief in the   last thing that stood fast of the earththe belief in substance in   matter in the earthresiduum and particleatom it is the greatest   triumph over the sens that ha hitherto been gained on earth One   must however go still further and also declare war relentless war   to the knife against the atomistic requirement which still lead a   dangerous afterlife in place where no one suspect them like the more   celebrated metaphysical requirement one must also above all give   the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which   Christianity ha taught best and longest the SOULATOMISM Let it be   permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regard the   soul a something indestructible eternal indivisible a a monad   a an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science Between   ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby   and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypothesesas   happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalist who can hardly   touch on the soul without immediately losing it But the way is open   for new acceptation and refinement of the soulhypothesis and such   conception a mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity   and soul a social structure of the instinct and passion want   henceforth to have legitimate right in science In that the NEW   psychologist is about to put an end to the superstition which have   hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of   the soul he is really a it were thrusting himself into a new desert   and a new distrustit is possible that the older psychologist had a   merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he find   that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENTand who know   perhaps to DISCOVER the new     13 Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the   instinct of selfpreservation a the cardinal instinct of an organic   being A living thing seek above all to DISCHARGE it strengthlife   itself is WILL TO POWER selfpreservation is only one of the indirect   and most frequent RESULTS thereof In short here a everywhere else   let u beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principlesone of which   is the instinct of selfpreservation we owe it to Spinozas   inconsistency It is thus in effect that method ordains which must   be essentially economy of principle     14 It is perhaps just dawning on five or six mind that natural   philosophy is only a worldexposition and worldarrangement according   to u if I may say so and NOT a worldexplanation but in so far a   it is based on belief in the sens it is regarded a more and for a   long time to come must be regarded a morenamely a an explanation   It ha eye and finger of it own it ha ocular evidence and   palpableness of it own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and   CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastesin fact it   follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism   What is clear what is explained Only that which can be seen and   feltone must pursue every problem thus far Obversely however the   charm of the Platonic mode of thought which wa an ARISTOCRATIC mode   consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious senseevidenceperhaps   among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious sens than our   contemporary but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining   master of them and this by mean of pale cold grey conceptional   network which they threw over the motley whirl of the sensesthe   mob of the sens a Plato said In this overcoming of the world and   interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato there wa an ENJOYMENT   different from that which the physicist of today offer usand likewise   the Darwinists and antiteleologists among the physiological worker   with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest   possible blunder Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there   is also nothing more for men to dothat is certainly an imperative   different from the Platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right   imperative for a hardy laborious race of machinist and bridgebuilders   of the future who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform     15 To study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist on   the fact that the senseorgans are not phenomenon in the sense of the   idealistic philosophy a such they certainly could not be cause   Sensualism therefore at least a regulative hypothesis if not a   heuristic principle What And others say even that the external world   is the work of our organ But then our body a a part of this external   world would be the work of our organ But then our organ themselves   would be the work of our organ It seems to me that this is a   complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM if the conception CAUSA SUI is something   fundamentally absurd Consequently the external world is NOT the work   of our organ     16 There are still harmless selfobservers who believe that there are   immediate certainty for instance I think or a the superstition   of Schopenhauer put it I will a though cognition here got hold   of it object purely and simply a the thing in itself without any   falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the   object I would repeat it however a hundred time that immediate   certainty a well a absolute knowledge and the thing in itself   involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO we really ought to free ourselves   from the misleading significance of word The people on their part may   think that cognition is knowing all about thing but the philosopher   must say to himself When I analyze the process that is expressed in   the sentence I think I find a whole series of daring assertion the   argumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible   for instance that it is I who think that there must necessarily be   something that think that thinking is an activity and operation on the   part of a being who is thought of a a cause that there is an ego   and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by   thinkingthat I KNOW what thinking is For if I had not already decided   within myself what it is by what standard could I determine whether   that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling In   short the assertion I think assumes that I COMPARE my state at the   present moment with other state of myself which I know in order to   determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with   further knowledge it ha at any rate no immediate certainty for   meIn place of the immediate certainty in which the people may   believe in the special case the philosopher thus find a series of   metaphysical question presented to him veritable conscience question   of the intellect to wit Whence did I get the notion of thinking   Why do I believe in cause and effect What give me the right to speak   of an ego and even of an ego a cause and finally of an ego   a cause of thought He who venture to answer these metaphysical   question at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception like   the person who say I think and know that this at least is   true actual and certainwill encounter a smile and two note of   interrogation in a philosopher nowadays Sir the philosopher will   perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not   mistaken but why should it be the truth     17 With regard to the superstition of logician I shall never tire   of emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by   these credulous mindsnamely that a thought come when it wish   and not when I wish so that it is a PERVERSION of the fact of the   case to say that the subject I is the condition of the predicate   think ONE think but that this one is precisely the famous old   ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and   assuredly not an immediate certainty After all one ha even gone too   far with this one thinkseven the one contains an INTERPRETATION of   the process and doe not belong to the process itself One infers here   according to the usual grammatical formulaTo think is an activity   every activity requires an agency that is active consequently It   wa pretty much on the same line that the older atomism sought besides   the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out   of which it operatesthe atom More rigorous mind however learnt at   last to get along without this earthresiduum and perhaps some day we   shall accustom ourselves even from the logician point of view to   get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego ha   refined itself     18 It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is   refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle   mind It seems that the hundredtimesrefuted theory of the free will   owes it persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing   who feel himself strong enough to refute it     19 Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will a though it were   the bestknown thing in the world indeed Schopenhauer ha given u   to understand that the will alone is really known to u absolutely and   completely known without deduction or addition But it again and   again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what   philosopher are in the habit of doinghe seems to have adopted a   POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it Willing seems to me to be above   all something COMPLICATED something that is a unity only in nameand   it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which ha got   the mastery over the inadequate precaution of philosopher in all age   So let u for once be more cautious let u be unphilosophical let   u say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensation   namely the sensation of the condition AWAY FROM WHICH we go the   sensation of the condition TOWARDS WHICH we go the sensation of this   FROM and TOWARDS itself and then besides an accompanying muscular   sensation which even without our putting in motion arm and leg   commences it action by force of habit directly we will anything   Therefore just a sensation and indeed many kind of sensation are   to be recognized a ingredient of the will so in the second place   thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is   a ruling thoughtand let u not imagine it possible to sever this   thought from the willing a if the will would then remain over   In the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation and   thinking but it is above all an EMOTION and in fact the emotion of the   command That which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the   emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey I am free he   must obeythis consciousness is inherent in every will and equally   so the straining of the attention the straight look which fix itself   exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and   nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience   will be renderedand whatever else pertains to the position of the   commander A man who WILLS command something within himself which   render obedience or which he belief render obedience But now let   u notice what is the strangest thing about the willthis affair so   extremely complex for which the people have only one name Inasmuch a   in the given circumstance we are at the same time the commanding AND   the obeying party and a the obeying party we know the sensation of   constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually   commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch a on the other   hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive   ourselves about it by mean of the synthetic term I a whole series   of erroneous conclusion and consequently of false judgment about the   will itself ha become attached to the act of willingto such a degree   that he who will belief firmly that willing SUFFICES for action   Since in the majority of case there ha only been exercise of will   when the effect of the commandconsequently obedience and therefore   actionwas to be EXPECTED the APPEARANCE ha translated itself into   the sentiment a if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT in a word he who   will belief with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are   somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing   to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation   of power which accompanies all success Freedom of Willthat is the   expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising   volition who command and at the same time identifies himself with   the executor of the orderwho a such enjoys also the triumph over   obstacle but think within himself that it wa really his own will   that overcame them In this way the person exercising volition add the   feeling of delight of his successful executive instrument the useful   underwills or undersoulsindeed our body is but a social structure   composed of many soulsto his feeling of delight a commander LEFFET   CEST MOI what happens here is what happens in every wellconstructed   and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifies   itself with the success of the commonwealth In all willing it is   absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis a   already said of a social structure composed of many soul on which   account a philosopher should claim the right to include willingassuch   within the sphere of moralsregarded a the doctrine of the relation   of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifest itself     20 That the separate philosophical idea are not anything optional or   autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with   each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear   in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just a much to   a system a the collective member of the fauna of a Continentis   betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most   diverse philosopher always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme   of POSSIBLE philosophy Under an invisible spell they always revolve   once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they   may feel themselves with their critical or systematic will something   within them lead them something impels them in definite order the   one after the otherto wit the innate methodology and relationship   of their idea Their thinking is in fact far le a discovery than a   rerecognizing a remembering a return and a homecoming to a faroff   ancient commonhousehold of the soul out of which those idea formerly   grew philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order   The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian Greek and German   philosophizing is easily enough explained In fact where there is   affinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammarI mean   owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical   functionsit can not but be that everything is prepared at the outset   for a similar development and succession of philosophical system   just a the way seems barred against certain other possibility of   worldinterpretation It is highly probable that philosopher within the   domain of the UralAltaic language where the conception of the subject   is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be   found on path of thought different from those of the IndoGermans and   Mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical function is ultimately   also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuation and racial conditionsSo   much by way of rejecting Lockes superficiality with regard to the   origin of idea     21 The CAUSA SUI is the best selfcontradiction that ha yet been   conceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the   extravagant pride of man ha managed to entangle itself profoundly and   frightfully with this very folly The desire for freedom of will   in the superlative metaphysical sense such a still hold sway   unfortunately in the mind of the halfeducated the desire to bear   the entire and ultimate responsibility for one action oneself and   to absolve God the world ancestor chance and society therefrom   involves nothing le than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI and with   more than Munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the   hair out of the slough of nothingness If any one should find out in   this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free   will and put it out of his head altogether I beg of him to carry   his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the   contrary of this monstrous conception of free will I mean nonfree   will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect One   should not wrongly MATERIALISE cause and effect a the natural   philosopher do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at   present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which make   the cause press and push until it effect it end one should use   cause and effect only a pure CONCEPTIONS that is to say a   conventional fiction for the purpose of designation and mutual   understandingNOT for explanation In beinginitself there is   nothing of casualconnection of necessity or of psychological   nonfreedom there the effect doe NOT follow the cause there law   doe not obtain It is WE alone who have devised cause sequence   reciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motive   and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this symbolworld   a beinginitself with thing we act once more a we have always   actedMYTHOLOGICALLY The nonfree will is mythology in real life   it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK willsIt is almost always   a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in every   causalconnection and psychological necessity manifest something   of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and nonfreedom   it is suspicious to have such feelingsthe person betrays himself And   in general if I have observed correctly the nonfreedom of the will   is regarded a a problem from two entirely opposite standpoint but   always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner some will not give up their   responsibility their belief in THEMSELVES the personal right to   THEIR merit at any price the vain race belong to this class others   on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed   for anything and owing to an inward selfcontempt seek to GET OUT OF   THE BUSINESS no matter how The latter when they write book are   in the habit at present of taking the side of criminal a sort of   socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise And a a matter of   fact the fatalism of the weakwilled embellishes itself surprisingly   when it can pose a la religion de la souffrance humaine that is ITS   good taste     22 Let me be pardoned a an old philologist who can not desist from   the mischief of putting his finger on bad mode of interpretation but   Natures conformity to law of which you physicist talk so proudly   a thoughwhy it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad   philology It is no matter of fact no text but rather just a   naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which   you make abundant concession to the democratic instinct of the modern   soul Everywhere equality before the lawNature is not different in   that respect nor better than we a fine instance of secret motive   in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and   autocraticlikewise a second and more refined atheismis once more   disguised Ni dieu ni maitrethat also is what you want and   therefore Cheers for natural lawis it not so But a ha been   said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along   who with opposite intention and mode of interpretation could read   out of the same Nature and with regard to the same phenomenon just   the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claim   of poweran interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and   unconditionalness of all Will to Power before your eye that almost   every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem   unsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphoras being too   human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about   this world a you do namely that it ha a necessary and calculable   course NOT however because law obtain in it but because they are   absolutely LACKING and every power effect it ultimate consequence   every moment Granted that this also is only interpretationand you   will be eager enough to make this objectionwell so much the better     23 All psychology hitherto ha run aground on moral prejudice and   timidity it ha not dared to launch out into the depth In so far   a it is allowable to recognize in that which ha hitherto been written   evidence of that which ha hitherto been kept silent it seems a if   nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology a the Morphology   and DEVELOPMENTDOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER a I conceive of it   The power of moral prejudice ha penetrated deeply into the most   intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and   unprejudiced and ha obviously operated in an injurious obstructive   blinding and distorting manner A proper physiopsychology ha to   contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator   it ha the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal   conditionalness of the good and the bad impulse cause a   refined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manly   consciencestill more so a doctrine of the derivation of all good   impulse from bad one If however a person should regard even   the emotion of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness   a lifeconditioning emotion a factor which must be present   fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which   must therefore be further developed if life is to be further   developed he will suffer from such a view of thing a from   seasickness And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest   and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous   knowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reason why every one   should keep away from it who CAN do so On the other hand if one ha   once drifted hither with one bark well very good now let u set our   teeth firmly let u open our eye and keep our hand fast on the helm   We sail away right OVER morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the   remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thitherbut   what do WE matter Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal   itself to daring traveler and adventurer and the psychologist who   thus make a sacrificeit is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto   on the contrarywill at least be entitled to demand in return that   psychology shall once more be recognized a the queen of the science   for whose service and equipment the other science exist For psychology   is once more the path to the fundamental problem         CHAPTER II THE FREE SPIRIT       24 O sanctum simplicitas In what strange simplification and   falsification man life One can never cease wondering when once one ha   got eye for beholding this marvel How we have made everything around   u clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give   our sens a passport to everything superficial our thought a godlike   desire for wanton prank and wrong inferenceshow from the beginning   we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost   inconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartiness   and gaietyin order to enjoy life And only on this solidified   granitelike foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself   hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful   will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue Not a   it opposite butas it refinement It is to be hoped indeed that   LANGUAGE here a elsewhere will not get over it awkwardness and that   it will continue to talk of opposite where there are only degree   and many refinement of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the   incarnated Tartuffery of moral which now belongs to our unconquerable   flesh and blood will turn the word round in the mouth of u   discerning one Here and there we understand it and laugh at the way   in which precisely the best knowledge seek most to retain u in this   SIMPLIFIED thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitably   falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it love   error because a living itself it love life     25 After such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be   heard it appeal to the most serious mind Take care ye philosopher   and friend of knowledge and beware of martyrdom Of suffering for the   truth sake even in your own defense It spoil all the innocence   and fine neutrality of your conscience it make you headstrong against   objection and red rag it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when   in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even   worse consequence of enmity ye have at last to play your last card   a protector of truth upon earthas though the Truth were such an   innocent and incompetent creature a to require protector and you of   all people ye knight of the sorrowful countenance Messrs Loafers and   Cobwebspinners of the spirit Finally ye know sufficiently well that   it can not be of any consequence if YE just carry your point ye know   that hitherto no philosopher ha carried his point and that there might   be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark   which you place after your special word and favourite doctrine and   occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and   trumping game before accuser and lawcourt Rather go out of the way   Flee into concealment And have your mask and your rus that ye may   be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared And pray do nt forget   the garden the garden with golden trelliswork And have people around   you who are a a gardenor a music on the water at eventide when   already the day becomes a memory Choose the GOOD solitude the free   wanton lightsome solitude which also give you the right still to   remain good in any sense whatsoever How poisonous how crafty how bad   doe every long war make one which can not be waged openly by mean   of force How PERSONAL doe a long fear make one a long watching   of enemy of possible enemy These pariah of society these   longpursued badlypersecuted onesalso the compulsory recluse the   Spinozas or Giordano Brunosalways become in the end even under the   most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware   of it refined vengeanceseekers and poisonBrewers just lay bare   the foundation of Spinozas ethic and theology not to speak of   the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a   philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour ha left him The   martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth   force into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him   and if one ha hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity   with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous   desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a   martyr into a stageandtribunebawler Only that it is necessary   with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any   casemerely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the   continued proof that the long real tragedy IS AT AN END supposing that   every philosophy ha been a long tragedy in it origin     26 Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy   where he is FREE from the crowd the many the majoritywhere he may   forget men who are the rule a their exceptionexclusive only of   the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger   instinct a a discerner in the great and exceptional sense Whoever in   intercourse with men doe not occasionally glisten in all the green   and grey colour of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy   gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated taste   supposing however that he doe not voluntarily take all this burden   and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains   a I said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then   certain he wa not made he wa not predestined for knowledge For a   such he would one day have to say to himself The devil take my good   taste but the rule is more interesting than the exceptionthan   myself the exception And he would go DOWN and above all he would   go inside The long and serious study of the AVERAGE manand   consequently much disguise selfovercoming familiarity and bad   intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one   equalsthat constitutes a necessary part of the lifehistory of every   philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing   part If he is fortunate however a a favourite child of knowledge   should be he will meet with suitable auxiliary who will shorten and   lighten his task I mean socalled cynic those who simply recognize   the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the   same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness a to make them   talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSESsometimes they   wallow even in book a on their own dunghill Cynicism is the only   form in which base soul approach what is called honesty and the   higher man must open his ear to all the coarser or finer cynicism and   congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before   him or the scientific satyr speaks out There are even case where   enchantment mix with the disgustnamely where by a freak of nature   genius is bound to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape a in the   case of the Abbe Galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also   filthiest man of his centuryhe wa far profounder than Voltaire and   consequently also a good deal more silent It happens more frequently   a ha been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an ape body a   fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no mean   rare especially among doctor and moral physiologist And whenever   anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man   a a belly with two requirement and a head with one whenever any one   see seek and WANTS to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity   a the real and only motif of human action in short when any one   speaks badlyand not even illof man then ought the lover of   knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general   to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation For the   indignant man and he who perpetually tear and lacerates himself with   his own teeth or in place of himself the world God or society   may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and   selfsatisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary   more indifferent and le instructive case And no one is such a LIAR   a the indignant man     27 It is

refinement of interpretation As regard the good   friend however who are always too easygoing and think that a   friend they have a right to ease one doe well at the very first to   grant them a playground and rompingplace for misunderstandingone can   thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good friendsand   laugh then also     28 What is most difficult to render from one language into another   is the TEMPO of it style which ha it basis in the character of the   race or to speak more physiologically in the average TEMPO of the   assimilation of it nutriment There are honestly meant translation   which a involuntary vulgarization are almost falsification of the   original merely because it lively and merry TEMPO which overleaps and   obviates all danger in word and expression could not also be   rendered A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language   consequently also a may be reasonably inferred for many of the most   delightful and daring NUANCES of free freespirited thought And just   a the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience   so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him Everything   ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all longwinded and wearying   specie of style are developed in profuse variety among Germanspardon   me for stating the fact that even Goethes prose in it mixture of   stiffness and elegance is no exception a a reflection of the good   old time to which it belongs and a an expression of German taste at a   time when there wa still a German taste which wa a rococotaste   in moribus et artibus Lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic   nature which understood much and wa versed in many thing he who wa   not the translator of Bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in   the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire and still more willingly among the   Roman comedywritersLessing loved also freespiritism in the TEMPO   and flight out of Germany But how could the German language even   in the prose of Lessing imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli who in his   Principe make u breathe the dry fine air of Florence and can not   help presenting the most serious event in a boisterous allegrissimo   perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he   venture to presentlong heavy difficult dangerous thought and   a TEMPO of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour Finally who   would venture on a German translation of Petronius who more than any   great musician hitherto wa a master of PRESTO in invention idea and   word What matter in the end about the swamp of the sick evil world   or of the ancient world when like him one ha the foot of a wind   the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which make   everything healthy by making everything RUN And with regard to   Aristophanesthat transfiguring complementary genius for whose   sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed provided one ha   understood in it full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and   transfiguration there is nothing that ha caused me to meditate more on   PLATOS secrecy and sphinxlike nature than the happily preserved petit   fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there wa found no   Bible nor anything Egyptian Pythagorean or Platonicbut a book of   Aristophanes How could even Plato have endured lifea Greek life which   he repudiatedwithout an Aristophanes     29 It is the business of the very few to be independent it is a   privilege of the strong And whoever attempt it even with the best   right but without being OBLIGED to do so prof that he is probably   not only strong but also daring beyond measure He enters into a   labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the danger which life in itself   already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see   how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal   by some minotaur of conscience Supposing such a one come to grief it   is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor   sympathize with it And he can not any longer go back He can not even go   back again to the sympathy of men     30 Our deepest insight mustand shouldappear a folly and under   certain circumstance a crime when they come unauthorizedly to   the ear of those who are not disposed and predestined for them The   exoteric and the esoteric a they were formerly distinguished by   philosophersamong the Indians a among the Greeks Persians and   Mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradation of rank and   NOT in equality and equal rightsare not so much in contradistinction   to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and   viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not   from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in   question view thing from below upwardswhile the esoteric class view   thing FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS There are height of the soul from which   tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically and if all the   woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether   the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy and   thus to a doubling of the woe That which serf the higher class of   men for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely   different and lower order of human being The virtue of the common   man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher it might be   possible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go   to ruin to acquire quality thereby alone for the sake of which he   would have to be honoured a a saint in the lower world into which he   had sunk There are book which have an inverse value for the soul and   the health according a the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the   higher and more powerful make use of them In the former case they are   dangerous disturbing unsettling book in the latter case they are   heraldcalls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery Books for the   general reader are always illsmelling book the odour of paltry people   cling to them Where the populace eat and drink and even where they   reverence it is accustomed to stink One should not go into church if   one wish to breathe PURE air     31 In our youthful year we still venerate and despise without the art   of NUANCE which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to do   hard penance for having fallen upon men and thing with Yea and Nay   Everything is so arranged that the worst of all taste THE TASTE FOR   THE UNCONDITIONAL is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learns   to introduce a little art into his sentiment and prefers to try   conclusion with the artificial a do the real artist of life The   angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no   peace until it ha suitably falsified men and thing to be able   to vent it passion upon them youth in itself even is something   falsifying and deceptive Later on when the young soul tortured by   continual disillusion finally turn suspiciously against itselfstill   ardent and savage even in it suspicion and remorse of conscience how   it upbraids itself how impatiently it tear itself how it revenge   itself for it long selfblinding a though it had been a voluntary   blindness In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one   sentiment one torture one enthusiasm with doubt one feel even the   good conscience to be a danger a if it were the selfconcealment and   lassitude of a more refined uprightness and above all one espouses   upon principle the cause AGAINST youthA decade later and one   comprehends that all this wa also stillyouth     32 Throughout the longest period of human historyone call it the   prehistoric periodthe value or nonvalue of an action wa inferred   from it CONSEQUENCES the action in itself wa not taken into   consideration any more than it origin but pretty much a in China at   present where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to   it parent the retrooperating power of success or failure wa what   induced men to think well or ill of an action Let u call this period   the PREMORAL period of mankind the imperative Know thyself wa   then still unknownIn the last ten thousand year on the other hand   on certain large portion of the earth one ha gradually got so far   that one no longer let the consequence of an action but it origin   decide with regard to it worth a great achievement a a whole an   important refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect   of the supremacy of aristocratic value and of the belief in origin   the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense a   the MORAL one the first attempt at selfknowledge is thereby   made Instead of the consequence the originwhat an inversion   of perspective And assuredly an inversion effected only after long   struggle and wavering To be sure an ominous new superstition a   peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely   thereby the origin of an action wa interpreted in the most definite   sense possible a origin out of an INTENTION people were agreed in the   belief that the value of an action lay in the value of it intention   The intention a the sole origin and antecedent history of an action   under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been   bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the   present dayIs it not possible however that the necessity may now   have arisen of again making up our mind with regard to the reversing   and fundamental shifting of value owing to a new selfconsciousness   and acuteness in manis it not possible that we may be standing on   the threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguished   negatively a ULTRAMORAL nowadays when at least among u immoralists   the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lie precisely   in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL and that all it intentionalness all   that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to it surface or   skinwhich like every skin betrays something but CONCEALS still   more In short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom   which first requires an explanationa sign moreover which ha too   many interpretation and consequently hardly any meaning in itself   alone that morality in the sense in which it ha been understood   hitherto a intentionmorality ha been a prejudice perhaps a   prematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rank   a astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be   surmounted The surmounting of morality in a certain sense even the   selfmounting of moralitylet that be the name for the longsecret   labour which ha been reserved for the most refined the most upright   and also the most wicked conscience of today a the living touchstone   of the soul     33 It can not be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice for   one neighbour and all selfrenunciationmorality must be mercilessly   called to account and brought to judgment just a the aesthetic   of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art   nowadays seek insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience   There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiment for others   and NOT for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here   and for one asking promptly Are they not perhapsDECEPTIONSThat   they PLEASEhim who ha them and him who enjoys their fruit and also   the mere spectatorthat is still no argument in their FAVOUR but just   call for caution Let u therefore be cautious     34 At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays   seen from every position the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we   think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eye can light   upon we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure u into   surmise concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of thing   He however who make thinking itself and consequently the spirit   responsible for the falseness of the worldan honourable exit which   every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avail himself ofhe   who regard this world including space time form and movement a   falsely DEDUCED would have at least good reason in the end to become   distrustful also of all thinking ha it not hitherto been playing upon   u the worst of scurvy trick and what guarantee would it give that   it would not continue to do what it ha always been doing In all   seriousness the innocence of thinker ha something touching and   respectinspiring in it which even nowadays permit them to wait upon   consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answer   for example whether it be real or not and why it keep the outer   world so resolutely at a distance and other question of the same   description The belief in immediate certainty is a MORAL NAIVETE   which doe honour to u philosopher butwe have now to cease being   MERELY moral men Apart from morality such belief is a folly which   doe little honour to u If in middleclass life an everready distrust   is regarded a the sign of a bad character and consequently a an   imprudence here among u beyond the middleclass world and it Yeas   and Nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the   philosopher ha at length a RIGHT to bad character a the being who   ha hitherto been most befooled on earthhe is now under OBLIGATION   to distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of   suspicionForgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of   expression for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate   differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and I keep at   least a couple of poke in the rib ready for the blind rage with which   philosopher struggle against being deceived Why NOT It is nothing   more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it   is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world So much must be   conceded there could have been no life at all except upon the basis   of perspective estimate and semblance and if with the virtuous   enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosopher one wished to do away   altogether with the seeming worldwell granted that YOU could do   thatat least nothing of your truth would thereby remain Indeed   what is it that force u in general to the supposition that there is an   essential opposition of true and false Is it not enough to suppose   degree of seemingness and a it were lighter and darker shade and   tone of semblancedifferent valeurs a the painter say Why might   not the world WHICH CONCERNS USbe a fiction And to any one who   suggested But to a fiction belongs an originatormight it not be   bluntly replied WHY May not this belong also belong to the fiction   Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the   subject just a towards the predicate and object Might not the   philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar All respect   to governess but is it not time that philosophy should renounce   governessfaith     35 O Voltaire O humanity O idiocy There is something ticklish in   the truth and in the SEARCH for the truth and if man go about it   too humanelyil ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bienI wager he   find nothing     36 Supposing that nothing else is given a real but our world of   desire and passion that we can not sink or rise to any other reality   but just that of our impulsesfor thinking is only a relation of these   impulse to one anotherare we not permitted to make the attempt and   to ask the question whether this which is given doe not SUFFICE by   mean of our counterpart for the understanding even of the socalled   mechanical or material world I do not mean a an illusion a   semblance a representation in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian   sense but a possessing the same degree of reality a our emotion   themselvesas a more primitive form of the world of emotion in   which everything still lie locked in a mighty unity which afterwards   branch off and develops itself in organic process naturally also   refines and debilitatesas a kind of instinctive life in which all   organic function including selfregulation assimilation nutrition   secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with   one anotheras a PRIMARY FORM of lifeIn the end it is not only   permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of   LOGICAL METHOD Not to assume several kind of causality so long a   the attempt to get along with a single one ha not been pushed to it   furthest extent to absurdity if I may be allowed to say so that is   a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadaysit follows   from it definition a mathematician say The question is ultimately   whether we really recognize the will a OPERATING whether we believe in   the causality of the will if we do soand fundamentally our belief IN   THIS is just our belief in causality itselfwe MUST make the attempt   to posit hypothetically the causality of the will a the only causality   Will can naturally only operate on willand not on matter not   on nerve for instance in short the hypothesis must be   hazarded whether will doe not operate on will wherever effect   are recognizedand whether all mechanical action inasmuch a a power   operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will   Granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive   life a the development and ramification of one fundamental form of   willnamely the Will to Power a my thesis put it granted that all   organic function could be traced back to this Will to Power and that   the solution of the problem of generation and nutritionit is one   problemcould also be found therein one would thus have acquired the   right to define ALL active force unequivocally a WILL TO POWER The   world seen from within the world defined and designated according to   it intelligible characterit would simply be Will to Power and   nothing else     37 What Does not that mean in popular language God is disproved but   not the devilOn the contrary On the contrary my friend And who   the devil also compels you to speak popularly     38 As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern time with   the French Revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous when   judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary   spectator of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own   indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately UNTIL THE TEXT HAS   DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION so a noble posterity might once   more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make   ITS aspect endurableOr rather ha not this already happened Have   not we ourselves beenthat noble posterity And in so far a we now   comprehend this is it notthereby already past     39 Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine a true merely because   it make people happy or virtuousexcepting perhaps the amiable   Idealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful   and let all kind of motley coarse and goodnatured desirability   swim about promiscuously in their pond Happiness and virtue are no   argument It is willingly forgotten however even on the part of   thoughtful mind that to make unhappy and to make bad are just a   little counterargument A thing could be TRUE although it were in   the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental   constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full   knowledge of itso that the strength of a mind might be measured by   the amount of truth it could endureor to speak more plainly by the   extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped   and falsified But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain   PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably   situated and have a greater likelihood of success not to speak of the   wicked who are happya specie about whom moralist are silent Perhaps   severity and craft are more favourable condition for the development of   strong independent spirit and philosopher than the gentle refined   yielding goodnature and habit of taking thing easily which are   prized and rightly prized in a learned man Presupposing always   to begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to the   philosopher who writes book or even introduces HIS philosophy into   booksStendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the   freespirited philosopher which for the sake of German taste I will   not omit to underlinefor it is OPPOSED to German taste Pour etre   bon philosophe say this last great psychologist il faut etre sec   clair sans illusion Un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du   caractere requis pour faire de decouvertes en philosophie cestadire   pour voir clair dans ce qui est     40 Everything that is profound love the mask the profoundest thing   have a hatred even of figure and likeness Should not the CONTRARY only   be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in A question   worth askingit would be strange if some mystic ha not already   ventured on the same kind of thing There are proceeding of such a   delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness   and make them unrecognizable there are action of love and of an   extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take   a stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his   recollection Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in   order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret   shame is inventive They are not the worst thing of which one is   most ashamed there is not only deceit behind a maskthere is so much   goodness in craft I could imagine that a man with something costly and   fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like   an old green heavilyhooped winecask the refinement of his shame   requiring it to be so A man who ha depth in his shame meet his   destiny and his delicate decision upon path which few ever reach   and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate   friend may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their   eye and equally so his regained security Such a hidden nature   which instinctively employ speech for silence and concealment and is   inexhaustible in evasion of communication DESIRES and insists that a   mask of himself shall occupy his place in the heart and head of his   friend and supposing he doe not desire it his eye will some day be   opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him thereand   that it is well to be so Every profound spirit need a mask nay more   around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing to   the constantly false that is to say SUPERFICIAL interpretation   of every word he utters every step he take every sign of life he   manifest     41 One must subject oneself to one own test that one is destined   for independence and command and do so at the right time One must not   avoid one test although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous   game one can play and are in the end test made only before ourselves   and before no other judge Not to cleave to any person be it even the   dearestevery person is a prison and also a recess Not to cleave to   a fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitousit is even   le difficult to detach one heart from a victorious fatherland Not   to cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiar   torture and helplessness chance ha given u an insight Not to cleave   to a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discovery   apparently specially reserved for u Not to cleave to one own   liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which   always fly further aloft in order always to see more under itthe   danger of the flier Not to cleave to our own virtue nor become a   a whole a victim to any of our specialty to our hospitality for   instance which is the danger of danger for highly developed   and wealthy soul who deal prodigally almost indifferently with   themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes   a vice One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELFthe best test of   independence     42 A new order of philosopher is appearing I shall venture to baptize   them by a name not without danger As far a I understand them a far   a they allow themselves to be understoodfor it is their nature to   WISH to remain something of a puzzlethese philosopher of the   future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated a   tempter This name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be   preferred a temptation     43 Will they be new friend of truth these coming philosopher Very   probably for all philosopher hitherto have loved their truth But   assuredly they will not be dogmatist It must be contrary to their   pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still   be truth for every onethat which ha hitherto been the secret wish   and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic effort My opinion is MY opinion   another person ha not easily a right to itsuch a philosopher of the   future will say perhaps One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to   agree with many people Good is no longer good when one neighbour   take it into his mouth And how could there be a common good The   expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of   small value In the end thing must be a they are and have always   beenthe great thing remain for the great the abyss for the   profound the delicacy and thrill for the refined and to sum up   shortly everything rare for the rare       44 Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free VERY   free spirit these philosopher of the futureas certainly also they   will not be merely free spirit but something more higher greater   and fundamentally different which doe not wish to be misunderstood and   mistaken But while I say this I feel under OBLIGATION almost a much   to them a to ourselves we free spirit who are their herald and   forerunner to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old   prejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog ha too long made the   conception of free spirit obscure In every country of Europe and the   same in America there is at present something which make an abuse of   this name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirit   who desire almost the opposite of what our intention and instinct   promptnot to mention that in respect to the NEW philosopher who are   appearing they must still more be closed window and bolted door   Briefly and regrettably they belong to the LEVELLERS these wrongly   named free spiritsas glibtongued and scribefingered slave of   the democratic taste and it modern idea all of them men without   solitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellow to whom   neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only they   are not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in their   innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and   failure in the old form in which society ha hitherto existeda notion   which happily inverts the truth entirely What they would fain attain   with all their strength is the universal greenmeadow happiness of the   herd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of life   for every one their two most frequently chanted song and doctrine   are called Equality of Rights and Sympathy with All Sufferersand   suffering itself is looked upon by them a something which must be   DONE AWAY WITH We opposite one however who have opened our eye and   conscience to the question how and where the plant man ha hitherto   grown most vigorously believe that this ha always taken place under   the opposite condition that for this end the dangerousness of his   situation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty and   dissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daring   under long oppression and compulsion and his Will to Life had to be   increased to the unconditioned Will to Powerwe believe that severity   violence slavery danger in the street and in the heart secrecy   stoicism tempter art and devilry of every kindthat everything   wicked terrible tyrannical predatory and serpentine in man serf   a well for the elevation of the human specie a it oppositewe do   not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH and in any case we   find ourselves here both with our speech and our silence at the OTHER   extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability a their   antipode perhaps What wonder that we free spirit are not exactly   the most communicative spirit that we do not wish to betray in every   respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from and WHERE perhaps it will   then be driven And a to the import of the dangerous formula Beyond   Good and Evil with which we at least avoid confusion we ARE something   else than librespenseurs liben pensatori freethinker   and whatever these honest advocate of modern idea like to call   themselves Having been at

hitherto attained the height depth and distance of these   experience the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME   and it still unexhausted possibility this is the preordained   huntingdomain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt But   how often must he say despairingly to himself A single individual   ala only a single individual and this great forest this virgin   forest So he would like to have some hundred of hunting assistant   and fine trained hound that he could send into the history of the   human soul to drive HIS game together In vain again and again he   experience profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to find   assistant and dog for all the thing that directly excite his   curiosity The evil of sending scholar into new and dangerous   huntingdomains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense   are required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the BIG   hunt and also the great danger commencesit is precisely then that   they lose their keen eye and nose In order for instance to divine and   determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE   ha hitherto had in the soul of homines religiosi a person would   perhaps himself have to posse a profound a bruised a immense an   experience a the intellectual conscience of Pascal and then he would   still require that widespread heaven of clear wicked spirituality   which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively   formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiencesBut who   could do me this service And who would have time to wait for such   servantsthey evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at   all time Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know   something which mean that one ha MUCH to doBut a curiosity like   mine is once for all the most agreeable of vicespardon me I mean to   say that the love of truth ha it reward in heaven and already upon   earth     46 Faith such a early Christianity desired and not infrequently   achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly freespirited world   which had century of struggle between philosophical school behind   it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which   the Imperium Romanum gavethis faith is NOT that sincere austere   slavefaith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell or some other   northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and   Christianity it is much rather the faith of Pascal which resembles in   a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reasona tough longlived   wormlike reason which is not to be slain at once and with a single   blow The Christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrifice   of all freedom all pride all selfconfidence of spirit it is at   the same time subjection selfderision and selfmutilation There is   cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to a   tender manysided and very fastidious conscience it take for granted   that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL that all the   past and all the habit of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum in   the form of which faith come to it Modern men with their obtuseness   a regard all Christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for the   terribly superlative conception which wa implied to an antique taste by   the paradox of the formula God on the Cross Hitherto there had never   and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so   dreadful questioning and questionable a this formula it promised a   transvaluation of all ancient valuesIt wa the Orient the PROFOUND   Orient it wa the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and it   noble lightminded toleration on the Roman Catholicism of nonfaith   and it wa always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the   halfstoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith   which made the slave indignant at their master and revolt against   them Enlightenment cause revolt for the slave desire the   unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in moral   he love a he hate without NUANCE to the very depth to the point   of pain to the point of sicknesshis many HIDDEN suffering make   him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering The   skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of   aristocratic morality wa not the least of the cause also of the   last great slaveinsurrection which began with the French Revolution     47 Wherever the religious neurosis ha appeared on the earth so far   we find it connected with three dangerous prescription a to regimen   solitude fasting and sexual abstinencebut without it being possible   to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or IF   any relation at all of cause and effect exists there This latter doubt   is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptom among   savage a well a among civilized people is the most sudden and   excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into   penitential paroxysm worldrenunciation and willrenunciation both   symptom perhaps explainable a disguised epilepsy But nowhere is it   MORE obligatory to put aside explanation around no other type ha there   grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems to   have been more interesting to men and even to philosophersperhaps it   is time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution or   better still to look AWAY TO GO AWAYYet in the background of the   most recent philosophy that of Schopenhauer we find almost a the   problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious   crisis and awakening How is the negation of will POSSIBLE how is the   saint possiblethat seems to have been the very question with which   Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher And thus it wa a   genuine Schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent   perhaps also his last a far a Germany is concerned namely Richard   Wagner should bring his own lifework to an end just here and should   finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage a Kundry   type vecu and a it loved and lived at the very time that the   maddoctors in almost all European country had an opportunity to study   the type close at hand wherever the religious neurosisor a I call   it the religious moodmade it latest epidemical outbreak and   display a the Salvation ArmyIf it be a question however a to   what ha been so extremely interesting to men of all sort in all age   and even to philosopher in the whole phenomenon of the saint it   is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous thereinnamely the   immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES of state of the soul regarded a   morally antithetical it wa believed here to be selfevident that   a bad man wa all at once turned into a saint a good man The   hitherto existing psychology wa wrecked at this point is it not   possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed   itself under the dominion of moral because it BELIEVED in opposition   of moral value and saw read and INTERPRETED these opposition   into the text and fact of the case What Miracle only an error of   interpretation A lack of philology     48 It seems that the Latin race are far more deeply attached to their   Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally and   that consequently unbelief in Catholic country mean something quite   different from what it doe among Protestantsnamely a sort of revolt   against the spirit of the race while with u it is rather a return to   the spirit or nonspirit of the race     We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous race even   a regard our talent for religionwe have POOR talent for it One   may make an exception in the case of the Celts who have theretofore   furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North the   Christian ideal blossomed forth in France a much a ever the pale sun   of the north would allow it How strangely pious for our taste are still   these later French skeptic whenever there is any Celtic blood in their   origin How Catholic how unGerman doe Auguste Comtes Sociology   seem to u with the Roman logic of it instinct How Jesuitical that   amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal SainteBeuve in spite of all   his hostility to Jesuits And even Ernest Renan how inaccessible to   u Northerners doe the language of such a Renan appear in whom   every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throw his refined   voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off it balance Let u repeat   after him these fine sentencesand what wickedness and haughtiness is   immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably le beautiful but   harder soul that is to say in our more German soulsDISONS DONC   HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT

religious life of the ancient   Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours   forthit is a very superior kind of man who take SUCH an attitude   towards nature and lifeLater on when the populace got the upper hand   in Greece FEAR became rampant also in religion and Christianity wa   preparing itself     50 The passion for God there are churlish honesthearted and   importunate kind of it like that of Lutherthe whole of Protestantism   lack the southern DELICATEZZA There is an Oriental exaltation of the   mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave a   in the case of St Augustine for instance who lack in an offensive   manner all nobility in bearing and desire There is a feminine   tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs   for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA a in the case of Madame de Guyon In   many case it appears curiously enough a the disguise of a girl   or youth puberty here and there even a the hysteria of an old maid   also a her last ambition The Church ha frequently canonized the woman   in such a case     51 The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before   the saint a the enigma of selfsubjugation and utter voluntary   privationwhy did they thus bow They divined in himand a it were   behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearancethe   superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation the   strength of will in which they recognized their own strength and   love of power and knew how to honour it they honoured something   in themselves when they honoured the saint In addition to this the   contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion such an   enormity of selfnegation and antinaturalness will not have been   coveted for nothingthey have said inquiringly There is perhaps a   reason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic might   wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutor and   visitor In a word the mighty one of the world learned to have a new   fear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconquered   enemyit wa the Will to Power which obliged them to halt before the   saint They had to question him     52 In the Jewish Old Testament the book of divine justice there are   men thing and saying on such an immense scale that Greek and Indian   literature ha nothing to compare with it One stand with fear and   reverence before those stupendous remains of what man wa formerly and   one ha sad thought about old Asia and it little outpushed peninsula   Europe which would like by all mean to figure before Asia a the   Progress of Mankind To be sure he who is himself only a slender   tame houseanimal and know only the want of a houseanimal like   our cultured people of today including the Christians of cultured   Christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruinsthe   taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to great and   small perhaps he will find that the New Testament the book of grace   still appeal more to his heart there is much of the odour of the   genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it To have bound   up this New Testament a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect along   with the Old Testament into one book a the Bible a The Book in   Itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the Spirit   which literary Europe ha upon it conscience     53 Why Atheism nowadays The father in God is thoroughly refuted   equally so the judge the rewarder Also his free will he doe   not hearand even if he did he would not know how to help The worst   is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he   uncertainThis is what I have made out by questioning and listening   at a variety of conversation to be the cause of the decline of   European theism it appears to me that though the religious instinct is   in vigorous growthit reject the theistic satisfaction with profound   distrust     54 What doe all modern philosophy mainly do Since Descartesand   indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedurean   ATTENTAT ha been made on the part of all philosopher on the old   conception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subject   and predicate conceptionthat is to say an ATTENTAT on the   fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine Modern philosophy   a epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly ANTICHRISTIAN   although for keener ear be it said by no mean antireligious   Formerly in effect one believed in the soul a one believed in   grammar and the grammatical subject one said I is the condition   think is the predicate and is conditionedto think is an activity for   which one MUST suppose a subject a cause The attempt wa then made   with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out   of this netto see if the opposite wa not perhaps true think the   condition and I the conditioned I therefore only a synthesis   which ha been MADE by thinking itself KANT really wished to prove   that starting from the subject the subject could not be provednor   the object either the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the   subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange   to himthe thought which once had an immense power on earth a the   Vedanta philosophy     55 There is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many round but   three of these are the most important Once on a time men sacrificed   human being to their God and perhaps just those they loved the   bestto this category belong the firstling sacrifice of all primitive   religion and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the   MithraGrotto on the Island of Capri that most terrible of all Roman   anachronism Then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificed   to their God the strongest instinct they possessed their nature   THIS festal joy shine in the cruel glance of ascetic and   antinatural fanatic Finally what still remained to be sacrificed   Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything   comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmony in   future blessedness and justice Was it not necessary to sacrifice God   himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity   gravity fate nothingness To sacrifice God for nothingnessthis   paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty ha been reserved for the   rising generation we all know something thereof already     56 Whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire ha long   endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it   from the halfChristian halfGerman narrowness and stupidity in which   it ha finally presented itself to this century namely in the form of   Schopenhauers philosophy whoever with an Asiatic and superAsiatic   eye ha actually looked inside and into the most worldrenouncing of   all possible mode of thoughtbeyond good and evil and no longer   like Buddha and Schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of   moralitywhoever ha done this ha perhaps just thereby without   really desiring it opened his eye to behold the opposite ideal the   ideal of the most worldapproving exuberant and vivacious man who ha   not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which wa and   is but wish to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS for all eternity   insatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the whole   piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires   the playand make it necessary because he always requires   himself anewand make himself necessaryWhat And this would not   becirculus vitiosus deus     57 The distance and a it were the space around man grows with the   strength of his intellectual vision and insight his world becomes   profounder new star new enigma and notion are ever coming into   view Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye ha exercised   it acuteness and profundity ha just been an occasion for it exercise   something of a game something for child and childish mind Perhaps   the most solemn conception that have caused the most fighting and   suffering the conception God and sin will one day seem to u of   no more importance than a child plaything or a child pain seems to   an old manand perhaps another plaything and another pain will then   be necessary once more for the old manalways childish enough an   eternal child     58 Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness or   semiidleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for it   favourite microscopic labour of selfexamination and for it soft   placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the   coming of God I mean the idleness with a good conscience the   idleness of olden time and of blood to which the aristocratic   sentiment that work is DISHONOURINGthat it vulgarizes body and   soulis not quite unfamiliar And that consequently the modern noisy   timeengrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates   and prepares for unbelief more than anything else Among these for   instance who are at present living apart from religion in Germany I   find freethinker of diversified specie and origin but above all   a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation   ha dissolved the religious instinct so that they no longer know what   purpose religion serve and only note their existence in the world   with a kind of dull astonishment They feel themselves already fully   occupied these good people be it by their business or by their   pleasure not to mention the Fatherland and the newspaper and   their family duty it seems that they have no time whatever left   for religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is a   question of a new business or a new pleasurefor it is impossible they   say to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoil   their temper They are by no mean enemy of religious custom   should certain circumstance State affair perhaps require their   participation in such custom they do what is required a so many   thing are donewith a patient and unassuming seriousness and without   much curiosity or discomfortthey live too much apart and outside   to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matter Among   those indifferent person may be reckoned nowadays the majority of   German Protestants of the middle class especially in the great   laborious centre of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious   scholar and the entire University personnel with the exception of   the theologian whose existence and possibility there always give   psychologist new and more subtle puzzle to solve On the part of   pious or merely churchgoing people there is seldom any idea of HOW   MUCH goodwill one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for a   German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole   profession and a I have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to   which he is compelled by his modern conscience incline him to a   lofty and almost charitable serenity a regard religion with which is   occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit   which he take for granted wherever any one still professes to belong   to the Church It is only with the help of history NOT through his own   personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing   himself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deference   in presence of religion but even when his sentiment have reached the   stage of gratitude towards them he ha not personally advanced one   step nearer to that which still maintains itself a Church or a piety   perhaps even the contrary The practical indifference to religious   matter in the midst of which he ha been born and brought up usually   sublimate itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which   shuns contact with religious men and thing and it may be just the   depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompt him to avoid the   delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with itEvery age ha   it own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other age   may envy it and how much naiveteadorable childlike and boundlessly   foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in   his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the   unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treat the   religious man a a lower and le valuable type beyond before and   ABOVE which he himself ha developedhe the little arrogant dwarf   and mobman the sedulously alert headandhand drudge of idea of   modern idea     59 Whoever ha seen deeply into the world ha doubtless divined what   wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial It is their   preservative instinct which teach them to be flighty lightsome and   false Here and there one find a passionate and exaggerated adoration   of pure form in philosopher a well a in artist it is not to be   doubted that whoever ha NEED of the cult of the superficial to that   extent ha at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it   Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt   child the born artist who find the enjoyment of life only in trying   to FALSIFY it image a if taking wearisome revenge on it one might   guess to what degree life ha disgusted them by the extent to which   they wish to see it image falsified attenuated ultrified and   deifiedone might reckon the homines religiosi among the artist a   their HIGHEST rank It is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable   pessimism which compels whole century to fasten their teeth into a   religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which   divine that truth might be attained TOO soon before man ha become   strong enough hard enough artist enough Piety the Life in God   regarded in this light would appear a the most elaborate and   ultimate product of the FEAR of truth a artistadoration   and artistintoxication in presence of the most logical of all   falsification a the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at   any price Perhaps there ha hitherto been no more effective mean of   beautifying man than piety by mean of it man can become so artful so   superficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longer   offends     60 To love mankind FOR GODS SAKEthis ha so far been the noblest and   remotest sentiment to which mankind ha attained That love to mankind   without any redeeming intention in the background is only an ADDITIONAL   folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love ha first to   get it proportion it delicacy it gram of salt and sprinkling   of ambergris from a higher inclinationwhoever first perceived   and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered a it   attempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time be   holy and respected a the man who ha so far flown highest and gone   astray in the finest fashion     61 The philosopher a WE free spirit understand himas the man of   the greatest responsibility who ha the conscience for the general   development of mankindwill use religion for his disciplining and   educating work just a he will use the contemporary political   and economic condition The selecting and disciplining   influencedestructive a well a creative and fashioningwhich can be   exercised by mean of religion is manifold and varied according to the   sort of people placed under it spell and protection For those who are   strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the   judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion is   an additional mean for overcoming resistance in the exercise of   authorityas a bond which bind ruler and subject in common   betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter   their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience And in the   case of the unique nature of noble origin if by virtue of superior   spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative   life reserving to themselves only the more refined form of government   over chosen disciple or member of an order religion itself may   be used a a mean for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of   managing GROSSER affair and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE   filth of all political agitation The Brahmins for instance understood   this fact With the help of a religious organization they secured to   themselves the power of nominating king for the people while their   sentiment prompted them to keep apart and outside a men with a higher   and superregal mission At the same time religion give inducement and   opportunity to some of the subject to qualify themselves for future   ruling and commanding the slowly ascending rank and class in which   through fortunate marriage custom volitional power and delight in   selfcontrol are on the increase To them religion offer sufficient   incentive and temptation to aspire to higher intellectuality and to   experience the sentiment of authoritative selfcontrol of silence and   of solitude Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable mean of   educating and ennobling a race which seek to rise above it hereditary   baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy And finally to   ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service and   general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion give   invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heart   ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy   with something of transfiguration and embellishment something of   justification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all   the semianimal poverty of their soul Religion together with the   religious significance of life shed sunshine over such perpetually   harassed men and make even their own aspect endurable to them it   operates upon them a the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon   sufferer of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manner   almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT and in the end even hallowing and   vindicating it There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity   and Buddhism a their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate   themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of thing and thereby   to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it   difficult enough to livethis very difficulty being necessary     62 To be sureto make also the bad counterreckoning against such   religion and to bring to light their secret dangersthe cost is   always excessive and terrible when religion do NOT operate a an   educational and disciplinary medium in the hand of the philosopher but   rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY when they wish to be the final end   and not a mean along with other mean Among men a among all other   animal there is a surplus of defective diseased degenerating   infirm and necessarily suffering individual the successful case   among men also are always the exception and in view of the fact that   man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT the rare   exception But worse still The higher the type a man represents the   greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED the accidental the   law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifest   itself most terribly in it destructive effect on the higher order of   men the condition of whose life are delicate diverse and difficult   to determine What then is the attitude of the two greatest religion   abovementioned to the SURPLUS of failure in life They endeavour   to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved in fact a the   religion FOR SUFFERERS they take the part of these upon principle   they are always in favour of those who suffer from life a from a   disease and they would fain treat every other experience of life a   false and impossible However highly we may esteem this indulgent and   preservative care inasmuch a in applying to others it ha applied   and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of   man the hitherto PARAMOUNT religionsto give a general appreciation   of themare among the principal cause which have kept the type of   man upon a lower levelthey have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD   HAVE PERISHED One ha to thank them for invaluable service and who is   sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation   of all that the spiritual men of Christianity have done for Europe   hitherto But when they had given comfort to the sufferer courage to   the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless   and when they had allured from society into convent and spiritual   penitentiary the brokenhearted and distracted what else had they   to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good   conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which   mean in deed and in truth to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE   EUROPEAN RACE To REVERSE all estimate of valueTHAT is what they   had to do And to shatter the strong to spoil great hope to cast   suspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomous   manly conquering and imperiousall instinct which are natural to the   highest and most successful type of maninto uncertainty distress   of conscience and selfdestruction forsooth to invert all love of the   earthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth and   earthly thingsTHAT is the task the Church imposed on itself and   wa obliged to impose until according to it standard of value   unworldliness unsensuousness and higher man fused into one   sentiment If one could observe the strangely painful equally coarse   and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and   impartial eye of an Epicurean god I should think one would never cease   marvelling and laughing doe it not actually seem that some single will   ha ruled over Europe for eighteen century in order to make a SUBLIME   ABORTION of man He however who with opposite requirement no longer   Epicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach this   almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind a exemplified in   the European Christian Pascal for instance would he not have to   cry aloud with rage pity and horror Oh you bungler presumptuous   pitiful bungler what have you done Was that a work for your hand   How you have

serpent     153 What is done out of love always take place beyond good and evil     154 Objection evasion joyous distrust and love of irony are sign of   health everything absolute belongs to pathology     155 The sense of the tragic increase and decline with sensuousness     156 Insanity in individual is something rarebut in group party   nation and epoch it is the rule     157 The

diverse sensitive and refined a the Science of Morals   belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarsefingeredan   interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious   in the very person of a moralist Indeed the expression Science   of Morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too   presumptuous and counter to GOOD tastewhich is always a foretaste of   more modest expression One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT   is still necessary here for a long time WHAT is alone proper for the   present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey   and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiment of worth   and distinction of worth which live grow propagate and perishand   perhaps attempt to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common   form of these living crystallizationsas preparation for a THEORY OF   TYPES of morality To be sure people have not hitherto been so modest   All the philosopher with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness   demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and   ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality a a science   they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to moralityand every philosopher hitherto   ha believed that he ha given it a basis morality itself however ha   been regarded a something given How far from their awkward pride   wa the seemingly insignificant problemleft in dust and decayof a   description of form of morality notwithstanding that the finest hand   and sens could hardly be fine enough for it It wa precisely owing to   moral philosopher knowing the moral fact imperfectly in an arbitrary   epitome or an accidental abridgementperhaps a the morality of   their environment their position their church their Zeitgeist their   climate and zoneit wa precisely because they were badly instructed   with regard to nation era and past age and were by no mean eager   to know about these matter that they did not even come in sight of the   real problem of moralsproblems which only disclose themselves by   a comparison of MANY kind of morality In every Science of Morals   hitherto strange a it may sound the problem of morality itself   ha been OMITTED there ha been no suspicion that there wa anything   problematic there That which philosopher called giving a basis to   morality and endeavoured to realize ha when seen in a right light   proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality a new   mean of it EXPRESSION consequently just a matteroffact within the   sphere of a definite morality yea in it ultimate motive a sort of   denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in questionand   in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and   vivisecting of this very faith Hear for instance with what   innocencealmost worthy of honourSchopenhauer represents his own   task and draw your conclusion concerning the scientificness of a   Science whose latest master still talk in the strain of child and   old wife The principle he say page 136 of the Grundprobleme der   Ethik Footnote Pages 5455 of Schopenhauers Basis of Morality   translated by Arthur B Bullock MA 1903 the axiom about the   purport of which all moralist are PRACTICALLY agreed neminem laede   immo omnes quantum potes juvais REALLY the proposition which all moral   teacher strive to establish   the REAL basis of ethic which   ha been sought like the philosopher stone for centuriesThe   difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be   greatit is well known that Schopenhauer also wa unsuccessful in his   effort and whoever ha thoroughly realized how absurdly false and   sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is Will   to Power may be reminded that Schopenhauer although a pessimist   ACTUALLYplayed the flute daily after dinner one may read about   the matter in his biography A question by the way a pessimist a   repudiator of God and of the world who MAKES A HALT at moralitywho   assent to morality and play the flute to laedeneminem moral what   Is that reallya pessimist     187 Apart from the value of such assertion a there is a categorical   imperative in u one can always ask What doe such an assertion   indicate about him who make it There are system of moral which are   meant to justify their author in the eye of other people other system   of moral are meant to tranquilize him and make him selfsatisfied   with other system he want to crucify and humble himself with others   he wish to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others   to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinctionthis system of   moral help it author to forget that system make him or something   of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and   creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps Kant   especially give u to understand by his moral that what is estimable   in me is that I know how to obeyand with you it SHALL not be   otherwise than with me In short system of moral are only a   SIGNLANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS     188 In contrast to laisseraller every system of moral is a sort of   tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no   objection unless one should again decree by some system of moral that   all kind of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is   essential and invaluable in every system of moral is that it is a   long constraint In order to understand Stoicism or Port Royal   or Puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every   language ha attained to strength and freedomthe metrical constraint   the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm How much trouble have the poet and   orator of every nation given themselvesnot excepting some of   the prose writer of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable   conscientiousnessfor the sake of a folly a utilitarian bungler   say and thereby deem themselves wisefrom submission to arbitrary   law a the anarchist say and thereby fancy themselves free even   freespirited The singular fact remains however that everything   of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly   certainty which exists or ha existed whether it be in thought itself   or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just a in   conduct ha only developed by mean of the tyranny of such arbitrary   law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely   this is nature and naturaland not laisseraller Every artist   know how different from the state of letting himself go is his   most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing   and constructing in the moment of inspirationand how strictly and   delicately he then obeys a thousand law which by their very rigidness   and precision defy all formulation by mean of idea even the most   stable idea ha in comparison therewith something floating manifold   and ambiguous in it The essential thing in heaven and in earth is   apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long OBEDIENCE   in the same direction there thereby result and ha always resulted in   the long run something which ha made life worth living for instance   virtue art music dancing reason spiritualityanything whatever   that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine The long bondage of   the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of   idea the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think   in accordance with the rule of a church or a court or conformable   to Aristotelian premise the persistent spiritual will to interpret   everything that happened according to a Christian scheme and in every   occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian Godall this   violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness   ha proved itself the disciplinary mean whereby the European spirit ha   attained it strength it remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility   granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be   stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here a everywhere   nature show herself a she is in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT   magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble That   for century European thinker only thought in order to prove   somethingnowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker   who wish to prove somethingthat it wa always settled beforehand   what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking a it wa perhaps   in the Asiatic astrology of former time or a it is still at the   present day in the innocent Christianmoral explanation of immediate   personal event for the glory of God or for the good of the   soulthis tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent   stupidity ha EDUCATED the spirit slavery both in the coarser and   the finer sense is apparently an indispensable mean even of spiritual   education and discipline One may look at every system of moral in this   light it is nature therein which teach to hate the laisseraller   the too great freedom and implant the need for limited horizon for   immediate dutiesit teach the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES and thus in   a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development   Thou must obey some one and for a long time OTHERWISE thou wilt come   to grief and lose all respect for thyselfthis seems to me to be the   moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical   a old Kant wished consequently the otherwise nor doe it address   itself to the individual what doe nature care for the individual   but to nation race age and rank above all however to the   animal man generally to MANKIND     189 Industrious race find it a great hardship to be idle it wa a   master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such   an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his weekand   workday againas a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated   FAST such a is also frequently found in the ancient world although   a is appropriate in southern nation not precisely with respect   to work Many kind of fast are necessary and wherever powerful   influence and habit prevail legislator have to see that intercalary   day are appointed on which such impulse are fettered and learn to   hunger anew Viewed from a higher standpoint whole generation and   epoch when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism   seem like those intercalated period of restraint and fasting during   which an impulse learns to humble and submit itselfat the same time   also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself certain philosophical sect likewise   admit of a similar interpretation for instance the Stoa in the midst   of Hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with   Aphrodisiacal odoursHere also is a hint for the explanation of the   paradox why it wa precisely in the most Christian period of European   history and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiment   that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amourpassion     190 There is something in the morality of Plato which doe not really   belong to Plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might   say in spite of him namely Socratism for which he himself wa   too noble No one desire to injure himself hence all evil is done   unwittingly The evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do   so however if he knew that evil is evil The evil man therefore is   only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily   make himgoodThis mode of reasoning savour of the POPULACE who   perceive only the unpleasant consequence of evildoing and practically   judge that it is STUPID to do wrong while they accept good a   identical with useful and pleasant without further thought As   regard every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it   ha the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom errPlato   did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the   tenet of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into themhe   the most daring of all interpreter who lifted the entire Socrates out   of the street a a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless   and impossible modificationsnamely in all his own disguise and   multiplicity In jest and in Homeric language a well what is the   Platonic Socrates if notGreek word inserted here     191 The old theological problem of Faith and Knowledge or more   plainly of instinct and reasonthe question whether in respect to the   valuation of thing instinct deserves more authority than rationality   which want to appreciate and act according to motif according to   a Why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utilityit   is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of   Socrates and had divided men mind long before Christianity Socrates   himself following of course the taste of his talentthat of a   surpassing dialecticiantook first the side of reason and in fact   what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the   noble Athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could   never give satisfactory answer concerning the motif of their action   In the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also   at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found   in himself the same difficulty and incapacity But whyhe said   to himselfshould one on that account separate oneself from the   instinct One must set them right and the reason ALSOone must follow   the instinct but at the same time persuade the reason to support them   with good argument This wa the real FALSENESS of that great and   mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he   wa satisfied with a kind of selfoutwitting in fact he perceived   the irrationality in the moral judgmentPlato more innocent in such   matter and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to   himself at the expenditure of all his strengththe greatest strength   a philosopher had ever expendedthat reason and instinct lead   spontaneously to one goal to the good to God and since Plato all   theologian and philosopher have followed the same pathwhich mean   that in matter of morality instinct or a Christians call it   Faith or a I call it the herd ha hitherto triumphed Unless   one should make an exception in the case of Descartes the father of   rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution who   recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and   Descartes wa superficial     192 Whoever ha followed the history of a single science find in   it development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest   process of all knowledge and cognizance there a here the   premature hypothesis the fiction the good stupid will to belief   and the lack of distrust and patience are first developedour sens   learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and   cautious organ of knowledge Our eye find it easier on a given   occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon   the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more   force more morality It is difficult and painful for the ear to   listen to anything new we hear strange music badly When we hear   another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sound   into word with which we are more familiar and conversantit wa thus   for example that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into   ARMBRUST crossbow Our sens are also hostile and averse to the   new and generally even in the simplest process of sensation the   emotion DOMINATEsuch a fear love hatred and the passive emotion   of indolenceAs little a a reader nowadays read all the single word   not to speak of syllable of a pagehe rather take about five out   of every twenty word at random and guess the probably appropriate   sense to themjust a little do we see a tree correctly and completely   in respect to it leaf branch colour and shape we find it so   much easier to fancy the chance of a tree Even in the midst of the   most remarkable experience we still do just the same we fabricate the   greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate   any event EXCEPT a inventor thereof All this go to prove   that from our fundamental nature and from remote age we have   beenACCUSTOMED TO LYING Or to express it more politely and   hypocritically in short more pleasantlyone is much more of an artist   than one is aware ofIn an animated conversation I often see the face   of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined   before me according to the thought he express or which I believe to   be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the   STRENGTH of my visual facultythe delicacy of the play of the muscle   and of the expression of the eye MUST therefore be imagined by me   Probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all     193 Quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise What we   experience in dream provided we experience it often pertains at   last just a much to the general belonging of our soul a anything   actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we   have a requirement more or le and finally in broad daylight and   even in the brightest moment of our waking life we are ruled to some   extent by the nature of our dream Supposing that someone ha often   flown in his dream and that at last a soon a he dream he is   conscious of the power and art of flying a his privilege and his   peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who belief that on the   slightest impulse he can actualize all sort of curve and angle who   know the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards   without effort or constraint a downwards without descending   or loweringwithout TROUBLEhow could the man with such   dreamexperiences and dreamhabits fail to find happiness differently   coloured and defined even in his waking hour How could he failto   long DIFFERENTLY for happiness Flight such a is described by poet   must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular   violent far too troublesome for him     194 The difference among men doe not manifest itself only in the   difference of their list of desirable thingsin their regarding   different good thing a worth striving for and being disagreed a to   the greater or le value the order of rank of the commonly recognized   desirable thingsit manifest itself much more in what they regard a   actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing As regard a woman   for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification   serf a an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the   more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for   possession see the questionableness the mere apparentness of such   ownership and wish to have finer test in order to know especially   whether the woman not only give herself to him but also give up for   his sake what she ha or would like to haveonly THEN doe he look upon   her a possessed A third however ha not even here got to the limit   of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether   the woman when she give up everything for him doe not perhaps do   so for a phantom of him he wish first to be thoroughly indeed   profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he venture to let   himself be found out Only then doe he feel the beloved one fully in   his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when   she love him just a much for the sake of his devilry and concealed   insatiability a for his goodness patience and spirituality One   man would like to posse a nation and he find all the higher art of   Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose Another with a more   refined thirst for possession say to himself One may not deceive   where one desire to possesshe is irritated and impatient at the idea   that a mask of him should rule in the heart of the people I must   therefore MAKE myself known and first of all learn to know myself   Among helpful and charitable people one almost always find the awkward   craftiness which first get up suitably him who ha to be helped a   though for instance he should merit help seek just THEIR help and   would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them   for all help With these conceit they take control of the needy a a   property just a in general they are charitable and helpful out of a   desire for property One find them jealous when they are crossed or   forestalled in their charity Parents involuntarily make something like   themselves out of their childrenthey call that education no mother   doubt at the bottom of her heart that the child she ha borne is   thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN   idea and notion of worth Indeed in former time father deemed it   right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly   born a among the ancient Germans And like the father so also do the   teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new   individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession The   consequence is     195 The Jewsa people born for slavery a Tacitus and the whole   ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nation a   they themselves say and believethe Jews performed the miracle of the   inversion of valuation by mean of which life on earth obtained a new   and dangerous charm for a couple of millennium Their prophet fused   into one the expression rich godless wicked violent   sensual and for the first time coined the word world a a term of   reproach In this inversion of valuation in which is also included   the use of the word poor a synonymous with saint and friend the   significance of the Jewish people is to be found it is with THEM that   the SLAVEINSURRECTION IN MORALS commences     196 It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark body near the   sunsuch a we shall never see Among ourselves this is an allegory   and the psychologist of moral read the whole starwriting merely a an   allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed     197 The beast of prey and the man of prey for instance Caesar Borgia   are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long a   one seek a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of   all tropical monster and growth or even an innate hell in themas   almost all moralist have done hitherto Does it not seem that there is   a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropic among moralist And   that the tropical man must be discredited at all cost whether   a disease and deterioration of mankind or a his own hell and   selftorture And why In favour of the temperate zone In favour   of the temperate men The moral The mediocreThis for the chapter   Morals a Timidity     198 All the system of moral which address themselves with a view to   their happiness a it is calledwhat else are they but suggestion   for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which   the individual live recipe for their passion their good and bad   propensity insofar a such have the Will to Power and would like   to play the master small and great expediency and elaboration   permeated with the musty odour of old family medicine and oldwife   wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their formbecause   they address themselves to all because they generalize where   generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally   and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely   with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even   seductive when they are overspiced and begin to smell dangerously   especially of the other world That is all of little value when   estimated intellectually and is far from being science much le   wisdom but repeated once more and three time repeated it is   expediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupidity   stupiditywhether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness   towards the heated folly of the emotion which the Stoics advised and   fostered or the nomorelaughing and nomoreweeping of Spinoza the   destruction of the emotion by their analysis and vivisection which he   recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotion to an innocent   mean at which they may be satisfied the Aristotelianism of moral   or even morality a the enjoyment of the emotion in a voluntary   attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps a   music or a love of God and of mankind for Gods sakefor in religion   the passion are once more enfranchised provided that or finally   even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotion a ha   been taught by Hafis and Goethe the bold lettinggo of the rein the   spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional case of   wise old codger and drunkard with whom it no longer ha much   dangerThis also for the chapter Morals a Timidity     199 Inasmuch a in all age a long a mankind ha existed there have   also been human herd family alliance community tribe people   state church and always a great number who obey in proportion   to the small number who commandin view therefore of the fact that   obedience ha been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto   one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is   now innate in every one a a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which give   the command Thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally   refrain from something in short Thou shalt This need try to   satisfy itself and to fill it form with a content according to it   strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes a an omnivorous   appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into   it ear by all sort of commandersparents teacher law class   prejudice or public opinion The extraordinary limitation of human   development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and   turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herdinstinct of   obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command If   one imagine this instinct increasing to it greatest extent commander   and independent individual will finally be lacking altogether or they   will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose   a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to   command just a if they also were only obeying This condition of thing   actually exists in Europe at presentI call it the moral hypocrisy of   the commanding class They know no other way of protecting themselves   from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executor of older   and higher order of predecessor of the constitution of justice of   the law or of God himself or they even justify themselves by maxim   from the current opinion of the herd a first servant of their   people or instrument of the public weal On the other hand the   gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air a if he were the only   kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his quality such a   public spirit kindness deference industry temperance modesty   indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and   useful to the herd a the peculiarly human virtue In case however   where it is believed that the leader and bellwether can not be dispensed   with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commander   by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative   constitution for example are of this origin In spite of all what a   blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the   appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeansof this   fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon wa the last great proof   the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of   the higher happiness to which the entire century ha attained in it   worthiest individual and period     200 The man of an age of dissolution which mix the race with   one another who ha the inheritance of a diversified descent in his   bodythat is to say contrary and often not only contrary instinct   and standard of value which struggle with one another and are seldom   at peacesuch a man of late culture and broken light will on an   average be a weak man His fundamental desire is that the war which is   IN HIM should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character   of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance Epicurean   or Christian it is above all thing the happiness of repose of   undisturbedness of repletion of final unityit is the Sabbath of   Sabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician St Augustine   who wa himself such a manShould however the contrariety and   conflict in such nature operate a an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus   to lifeand if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and   irreconcilable instinct they have also inherited and indoctrinated   into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict   with themselves that is to say the faculty of selfcontrol and   selfdeception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and   inexplicable being those enigmatical men predestined for conquering   and circumventing others the finest example of which are Alcibiades   and Caesar with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans   according to my taste the Hohenstaufen Frederick the Second and   among artist perhaps Leonardo da Vinci They appear precisely in the   same period when that weaker type with it longing for repose come   to the front the two type are complementary to each other and spring   from the same cause     201 As long a the utility which determines moral estimate is only   gregarious utility a long a the preservation of the community is only   kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in   what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be   no morality of love to one neighbour Granted even that there is   already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness   gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition   of society all those instinct are already active which are latterly   distinguished by honourable name a virtue and eventually almost   coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not   a yet belong to the domain of moral valuationsthey are still   ULTRAMORAL A sympathetic action for instance is neither called good   nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the Romans and should   it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this   praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared   with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the RES   PUBLICA After all love to our neighbour is always a secondary   matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to   our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR After the fabric of society seems on the   whole established and secured against external danger it is this   fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspective of moral   valuation Certain strong and dangerous instinct such a the love of   enterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and   love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the   point of view of general utilityunder other name of course than   those here givenbut had to be fostered and cultivated because they   were perpetually required in the common danger against the common   enemy are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strongwhen   the outlet for them are lackingand are gradually branded a immoral   and given over to calumny The contrary instinct and inclination now   attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draw it   conclusion How much or how little dangerousness to the community or   to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a   disposition or an endowmentthat is now the moral perspective here   again fear is the mother of moral It is by the loftiest and strongest   instinct when they break out passionately and carry the individual   far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious   conscience that the selfreliance of the community is destroyed it   belief in itself it backbone a it were break consequently these   very instinct will be most branded and defamed The lofty independent   spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are   felt to be danger everything that elevates the individual above the   herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called   EVIL the tolerant unassuming selfadapting selfequalizing   disposition the MEDIOCRITY of desire attains to moral distinction and   honour Finally under very peaceful circumstance there is always   le opportunity and necessity for training the feeling to severity   and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begin   to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and   selfresponsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb   and still more the sheep win respect There is a point of diseased   mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society   itself take the part of him who injures it the part of the CRIMINAL   and doe so in fact seriously and honestly To punish appears to it   to be somehow unfairit is certain that the idea of punishment and   the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people Is   it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS Why should we   still punish Punishment itself is terriblewith these question   gregarious morality the morality of fear draw it ultimate   conclusion If one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear   one would have done away with this morality at the same time it   would no longer be necessary it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer   necessaryWhoever examines the conscience of the presentday European   will always elicit the same imperative from it thousand moral fold   and hidden recess the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish   that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR Some time   or otherthe will and the way THERETO is nowadays called progress all   over Europe     202 Let u at once say again what we have already said a hundred   time for people ear nowadays are unwilling to hear such truthsOUR   truth We know well enough how offensive it sound when any one   plainly and without metaphor count man among the animal but it will   be accounted to u almost a CRIME that it is precisely in respect to   men of modern idea that we have constantly applied the term herd   herdinstincts and such like expression What avail is it We can not   do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is We   have found that in all the principal moral judgment Europe ha become   unanimous including likewise the country where European influence   prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he   did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to   teachthey know today what is good and evil It must then sound hard   and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which   here think it know that which here glorifies itself with praise   and blame and call itself good is the instinct of the herding human   animal the instinct which ha come and is ever coming more and more   to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instinct   according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance   of which it is the symptom MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS   HERDINGANIMAL MORALITY and therefore a we understand the matter   only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after   which many other morality and above all HIGHER morality are or   should be possible Against such a possibility against such a should   be however this morality defends itself with all it strength it   say obstinately and inexorably I am morality itself and nothing else   is morality Indeed with the help of a religion which ha humoured   and flattered the sublimest desire of the herdinganimal thing have   reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of   this morality even in political and social arrangement the DEMOCRATIC   movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement That it TEMPO   however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient one for   those who are sick and distracted by the herdinginstinct is indicated   by the increasingly furious howling and always le disguised   teethgnashing of the anarchist dog who are now roving through the   highway of European culture Apparently in opposition to the peacefully   industrious democrat and Revolutionideologues and still more so   to the awkward philosophasters and fraternityvisionaries who call   themselves Socialists and want a free society those are really at one   with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form   of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd to the extent even of   repudiating the notion master and servantni dieu ni maitre say   a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every   special claim every special right and privilege this mean ultimately   opposition to EVERY right for when all are equal no one need right   any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice a though it   were a violation of the weak unfair to the NECESSARY consequence of   all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy   in their compassion for all that feel life and suffers down to the   very animal up even to Godthe extravagance of sympathy for   God belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and   impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering   generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or   ALLOWING it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heartsoftening   under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new   Buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy a   though it were morality in itself the climax the ATTAINED climax of   mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present   the great discharge from all the obligation of the past altogether at   one in their belief in the community a the DELIVERER in the herd and   therefore in themselves     203 We who hold a different beliefwe who regard the democratic   movement not only a a degenerating form of political organization but   a equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man a involving his   mediocrising and depreciation where have WE to fix our hope In   NEW PHILOSOPHERSthere is no other alternative in mind strong and   original enough to initiate opposite estimate of value to transvalue   and invert eternal valuation in forerunner in men of the future   who in the present shall fix the constraint and fasten the knot which   will compel millennium to take NEW path To teach man the future   of humanity a his WILL a depending on human will and to make   preparation for vast hazardous enterprise and collective attempt in   rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful   rule of folly and chance which ha hitherto gone by the name of   history the folly of the greatest number is only it last   formfor that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will   some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that   ha existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent being might   look pale and dwarfed The image of such leader hovers before OUR   eyesis it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirit The   condition which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for   their genesis the presumptive method and test by virtue of which   a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power a to feel a   CONSTRAINT to these task a transvaluation of value under the new   pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart   transformed into brass so a to bear the weight of such responsibility   and on the other hand the necessity for such leader the dreadful   danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degeneratethese   are OUR real anxiety and gloom ye know it well ye free spirit   these are the heavy distant thought and storm which sweep across the   heaven of OUR life There are few pain so grievous a to have seen   divined or experienced how an exceptional man ha missed his way and   deteriorated but he who ha the rare eye for the universal danger   of man himself DETERIORATING he who like u ha recognized the   extraordinary fortuitousness which ha hitherto played it game in   respect to the future of mankinda game in which neither the hand nor   even a finger of God ha participatedhe who divine the fate that   is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of   modern idea and still more under the whole of ChristoEuropean   moralitysuffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared   He see at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through   a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human power and   arrangement he know with all the knowledge of his conviction how   unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibility and how often   in the past the type man ha stood in presence of mysterious decision   and new pathshe know still better from his painfulest recollection   on what wretched obstacle promising development of the highest rank   have hitherto usually gone to piece broken down sunk and become   contemptible The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of   the man of the futureas idealized by the socialistic fool and   shallowpatesthis degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely   gregarious animal or a they call it to a man of free society   this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal right and claim is   undoubtedly POSSIBLE He who ha thought out this possibility to it   ultimate conclusion know ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of   mankindand perhaps also a new MISSION         CHAPTER VI WE SCHOLARS       204 At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here a that   which it ha always beennamely resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES   according to BalzacI would venture to protest against an improper and   injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and a if with the   best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relation   of science and philosophy I mean to say that one must have the right   out of one own EXPERIENCEexperience a it seems to me always   implies unfortunate experienceto treat of such an important question   of rank so a not to speak of colour like the blind or AGAINST science   like woman and artist Ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct   and their shame it always FINDS THINGS OUT The declaration of   independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy   is one of the subtler aftereffect of democratic organization and   disorganization the selfglorification and selfconceitedness of   the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in it best   springtimewhich doe not mean to imply that in this case selfpraise   smell sweet Here also the instinct of the populace cry Freedom   from all master and after science ha with the happiest result   resisted theology whose handmaid it had been too long it now   proposes in it wantonness and indiscretion to lay down law for   philosophy and in it turn to play the masterwhat am I saying   to play the PHILOSOPHER on it own account My memorythe memory of   a scientific man if you pleaseteems with the naivete of insolence   which I have heard about philosophy and philosopher from young   naturalist and old physician not to mention the most cultured and   most conceited of all learned men the philologist and schoolmaster   who are both the one and the other by profession On one occasion it   wa the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the   defensive against all synthetic task and capability at another time   it wa the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined   luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt   himself aggrieved and belittled thereby On another occasion it wa the   colourblindness of the utilitarian who see nothing in philosophy but   a series of REFUTED system and an extravagant expenditure which doe   nobody any good At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of   the boundaryadjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another   time the disregard of individual philosopher which had involuntarily   extended to disregard of philosophy generally In fine I found most   frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholar   the evil aftereffect of some particular philosopher to whom on the   whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his   scornful estimate of other philosopher having been got rid ofthe   result being a general illwill to all philosophy Such seems to   me for instance the aftereffect of Schopenhauer on the most modern   Germany by his unintelligent rage against Hegel he ha succeeded in   severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from it connection   with German culture which culture all thing considered ha been   an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE but   precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself wa poor irreceptive   and unGerman to the extent of ingeniousness On the whole speaking   generally it may just have been the humanness alltoohumanness of the   modern philosopher themselves in short their contemptibleness which   ha injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the   door to the instinct of the populace Let it but be acknowledged to   what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the   world of Heraclitus Plato Empedocles and whatever else all the royal   and magnificent anchorite of the spirit were called and with what   justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and   origin in view of such representative of philosophy who owing to   the fashion of the present day are just a much aloft a they are down   belowin Germany for instance the two lion of Berlin the anarchist   Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann It is especially   the sight of those hotchpotch philosopher who call themselves   realist or positivist which is calculated to implant a   dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those   philosopher at the best are themselves but scholar and specialist   that is very evident All of them are person who have been vanquished   and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science who at one time   or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the   more and it responsibilityand who now creditably rancorously and   vindictively represent in word and deed DISBELIEF in the mastertask   and supremacy of philosophy After all how could it be otherwise   Science flourish nowadays and ha the good conscience clearly visible   on it countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy ha   gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites   distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to   a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of   epoch and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even   get beyond the threshold and rigorously DENIES itself the right   to enterthat is philosophy in it last throe an end an agony   something that awakens pity How could such a philosophyRULE     205 The danger that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in   fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit   could still come to maturity The extent and towering structure of the   science have increased enormously and therewith also the probability   that the philosopher will grow tired even a a learner or will attach   himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to   his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection   and his DESPECTION Or he get aloft too late when the best of his   maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and   deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of thing is no   longer of much importance It is perhaps just the refinement of his   intellectual conscience that make him hesitate and linger on the   way he dread the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede a   milleantenna he know too well that a a discerner one who ha lost   his selfrespect no longer command no longer LEADS unless he should   aspire to become a great playactor a philosophical Cagliostro and   spiritual ratcatcherin short a misleader This is in the last   instance a question of taste if it ha not really been a question of   conscience To double once more the philosopher difficulty there is   also the fact that he demand from himself a verdict a Yea or Nay not   concerning science but concerning life and the worth of lifehe learns   unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain   this verdict and he ha to seek his way to the right and the belief   only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying   experience often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded In fact the   philosopher ha long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either   with the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiously   elevated desensualized desecularized visionary and Godintoxicated   man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he life   wisely or a a philosopher it hardly mean anything more than   prudently and apart Wisdom that seems to the populace to be a kind   of flight a mean and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a   bad game but the GENUINE philosopherdoes it not seem so to US   my friendslives unphilosophically and unwisely above all   IMPRUDENTLY and feel the obligation and burden of a hundred attempt   and temptation of lifehe risk HIMSELF constantly he play THIS bad   game     206 In relation to the genius that is to say a being who either   ENGENDERS or PRODUCESboth word understood in their fullest sensethe   man of learning the scientific average man ha always something of   the old maid about him for like her he is not conversant with the two   principal function of man To both of course to the scholar and   to the old maid one concedes respectability a if by way of   indemnificationin these case one emphasizes the respectabilityand   yet in the compulsion of this concession one ha the same admixture   of vexation Let u examine more closely what is the scientific man   Firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtue that is   to say a nonruling nonauthoritative and nonselfsufficient type   of man he posse industry patient adaptableness to rank and file   equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he ha the   instinct for people like himself and for that which they requirefor   instance the portion of independence and green meadow without which   there is no rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration   which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability   the sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value and   usefulness with which the inward DISTRUST which lie at the bottom of   the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animal ha again and   again to be overcome The learned man a is appropriate ha also   malady and fault of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and   ha a lynxeye for the weak point in those nature to whose elevation   he can not attain He is confiding yet only a one who let himself go   but doe not FLOW and precisely before the man of the great current he   stand all the colder and more reservedhis eye is then like a smooth   and irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy   The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable result   from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the Jesuitism of   mediocrity which labour instinctively for the destruction of   the exceptional man and endeavour to breakor still better to   relaxevery bent bow To relax of course with consideration and   naturally with an indulgent handto RELAX with confiding sympathy   that is the real art of Jesuitism which ha always understood how to   introduce itself a the religion of sympathy     207 However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spiritand   who ha not been sick to death of all subjectivity and it confounded   IPSISIMOSITYin the end however one must learn caution even with   regard to one gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with   which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit ha recently been   celebrated a if it were the goal in itself a if it were salvation   and glorificationas is especially accustomed to happen in the   pessimist school which ha also in it turn good reason for paying the   highest honour to disinterested knowledge The objective man who no   longer curse and scold like the pessimist the IDEAL man of learning   in whom the scientific instinct blossom forth fully after a thousand   complete and partial failure is assuredly one of the most costly   instrument that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more   powerful He is only an instrument we may say he is a MIRRORhe is no   purpose in himself The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed   to prostration before everything that want to be known with such   desire only a knowing or reflecting implieshe wait until   something come and then expands himself sensitively so that even the   light footstep and glidingpast of spiritual being may not be lost on   his surface and film Whatever personality he still posse seems to   him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much ha he   come to regard himself a the passage and reflection of outside form   and event He call up the recollection of himself with an effort   and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other   person he make mistake with regard to his own need and here only   is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health   or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack   of companion and societyindeed he set himself to reflect on his   suffering but in vain His thought already rove away to the MORE   GENERAL case and tomorrow he know a little a he knew yesterday how   to help himself He doe not now take himself seriously and devote time   to himself he is serene NOT from lack of trouble but from lack   of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual   complaisance with respect to all object and experience the radiant   and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that   come his way his habit of inconsiderate goodnature of dangerous   indifference a to Yea and Nay ala there are enough of case in which   he ha to atone for these virtue of hisand a man generally he   becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtue Should one   wish love or hatred from himI mean love and hatred a God woman and   animal understand themhe will do what he can and furnish what he can   But one must not be surprised if it should not be muchif he should   show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and   deteriorated His love is constrained his hatred is artificial and   rather UN TOUR DE FORCE a slight ostentation and exaggeration He is   only genuine so far a he can be objective only in his serene totality   is he still nature and natural His mirroring and eternally   selfpolishing soul no longer know how to affirm no longer how to   deny he doe not command neither doe he destroy JE NE MEPRISE   PRESQUE RIENhe say with Leibniz let u not overlook nor undervalue   the PRESQUE Neither is he a model man he doe not go in advance of any   one nor after either he place himself generally too far off to have   any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil If he ha   been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER with the Caesarian trainer   and dictator of civilization he ha had far too much honour and what   is more essential in him ha been overlookedhe is an instrument   something of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but   nothing in himselfPRESQUE RIEN The objective man is an instrument   a costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and   mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he   is no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom the   REST of existence justifies itself no terminationand still le a   commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful   selfcentred that want to be master but rather only a soft inflated   delicate movable pottersform that must wait for some kind of content   and frame to shape itself theretofor the most part a man without   frame and content a selfless man Consequently also nothing for   woman IN PARENTHESI     208 When a philosopher nowadays make known that he is not a skepticI   hope that ha been gathered from the foregoing description of the   objective spiritpeople all hear it impatiently they regard him on   that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many   many question indeed among timid hearer of whom there are now so   many he is henceforth said to be dangerous With his repudiation of   skepticism it seems to them a if they heard some evilthreatening   sound in the distance a if a new kind of explosive were being tried   somewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered Russian   NIHILINE a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS that not only denies mean   denial butdreadful thought PRACTISES denial Against this kind of   goodwilla will to the veritable actual negation of lifethere is   a is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedative   than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism   and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctor of the day a an   antidote to the spirit and it underground noise Are not our ear   already full of bad sound say the skeptic a lover of repose and   almost a a kind of safety police this subterranean Nay is terrible   Be still ye pessimistic mole The skeptic in effect that delicate   creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so   a to start at every Nay and even at that sharp decided Yea and feel   something like a bite thereby Yea and Naythey seem to him opposed   to morality he love on the contrary to make a festival to his virtue   by a noble aloofness while perhaps he say with Montaigne What do I   know Or with Socrates I know that I know nothing Or Here I do   not trust myself no door is open to me Or Even if the door were   open why should I enter immediately Or What is the use of any hasty   hypothesis It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypothesis   at all Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is   crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum Is there not time   enough for that Has not the time leisure Oh ye demon can ye not   at all WAIT The uncertain also ha it charm the Sphinx too is a   Circe and Circe too wa a philosopherThus doe a skeptic console   himself and in truth he need some consolation For skepticism is   the most spiritual expression of a certain manysided physiological   temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and   sickliness it arises whenever race or class which have been long   separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another In the new   generation which ha inherited a it were different standard and   valuation in it blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt and   tentativeness the best power operate restrictively the very virtue   prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast   and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul That however   which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescript is the   WILL they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or   the courageous feeling of pleasure in willingthey are doubtful of the   freedom of the will even in their dream Our presentday Europe   the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of   class and CONSEQUENTLY of race is therefore skeptical in all it   height and depth sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which   spring impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with   gloomy aspect like a cloud overcharged with interrogative signsand   often sick unto death of it will Paralysis of will where do we not   find this cripple sitting nowadays And yet how bedecked oftentimes How   seductively ornamented There are the finest gala dress and disguise   for this disease and that for instance most of what place itself   nowadays in the showcase a objectiveness the scientific spirit   LART POUR LART and pure voluntary knowledge is only deckedout   skepticism and paralysis of willI am ready to answer for this   diagnosis of the European diseaseThe disease of the will is diffused   unequally over Europe it is worst and most varied where civilization   ha longest prevailed it decrease according a the barbarian   stillor againasserts his claim under the loose drapery of Western   culture It is therefore in the France of today a can be readily   disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and France   which ha always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the   portentous crisis of it spirit into something charming and seductive   now manifest emphatically it intellectual ascendancy over Europe   by being the school and exhibition of all the charm of skepticism The   power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already   somewhat stronger in Germany and again in the North of Germany it   is stronger than in Central Germany it is considerably stronger in   England Spain and Corsica associated with phlegm in the former and   with hard skull in the latternot to mention Italy which is too young   yet to know what it want and must first show whether it can exercise   will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense   middle empire where Europe a it were flow back to Asianamely in   Russia There the power to will ha been long stored up and accumulated   there the willuncertain whether to be negative or affirmativewaits   threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our   physicist Perhaps not only Indian war and complication in Asia would   be necessary to free Europe from it greatest danger but also internal   subversion the shattering of the empire into small state and above   all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the   obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not   say this a one who desire it in my heart I should rather prefer the   contraryI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of   Russia that Europe would have to make up it mind to become equally   threateningnamely TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL by mean of a new caste to   rule over the Continent a persistent dreadful will of it own that   can set it aim thousand of year ahead so that the long spunout   comedy of it pettystatism and it dynastic a well a it democratic   manywilledness might finally be brought to a close The time for   petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle for the   dominion of the worldthe COMPULSION to great politics     209 As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have   evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger   kind of skepticism I should like to express myself preliminarily   merely by a parable which the lover of German history will already   understand That unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadier   who a King of Prussia brought into being a military and skeptical   geniusand therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emerged   type of German the problematic crazy father of Frederick the Great   had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew   what wa then lacking in Germany the want of which wa a hundred time   more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social formhis   illwill to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound   instinct MEN WERE LACKING and he suspected to his bitterest regret   that his own son wa not man enough There however he deceived   himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place He saw   his son lapsed to atheism to the ESPRIT to the pleasant frivolity of   clever Frenchmenhe saw in the background the great bloodsucker the   spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no   longer hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that no   longer command is no longer ABLE to command Meanwhile however   there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous   skepticismwho know TO WHAT EXTENT it wa encouraged just by   his father hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to   solitudethe skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related   to the genius for war and conquest and made it first entrance into   Germany in the person of the great Frederick This skepticism despises   and nevertheless grasp it undermines and take possession it doe   not believe but it doe not thereby lose itself it give the spirit a   dangerous liberty but it keep strict guard over the heart It is the   GERMAN form of skepticism which a a continued Fredericianism risen   to the highest spirituality ha kept Europe for a considerable time   under the dominion of the German spirit and it critical and historical   distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character   of the great German philologist and historical critic who   rightly estimated were also all of them artist of destruction   and dissolution a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually   established itselfin spite of all Romanticism in music and   philosophyin which the leaning towards masculine skepticism wa   decidedly prominent whether for instance a fearlessness of gaze a   courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or a resolute will to   dangerous voyage of discovery to spiritualized North Pole expedition   under barren and dangerous sky There may be good ground for it when   warmblooded and superficial humanitarian cross themselves before this   spirit CET ESPRIT FATALISTE IRONIQUE MEPHISTOPHELIQUE a Michelet   call it not without a shudder But if one would realize how   characteristic is this fear of the man in the German spirit which   awakened Europe out of it dogmatic slumber let u call to mind the   former conception which had to be overcome by this new oneand that   it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare with   unbridled presumption to recommend the Germans to the interest of   Europe a gentle goodhearted weakwilled and poetical fool   Finally let u only understand profoundly enough Napoleons   astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for   century a the German spirit VOILA UN HOMMEthat wa a much a   to say But this is a MAN And I only expected to see a German     210 Supposing then that in the picture of the philosopher of the   future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps   be skeptic in the lastmentioned sense something in them would only be   designated therebyand not they themselves With equal right they might   call themselves critic and assuredly they will be men of experiment   By the name with which I ventured to baptize them I have already   expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is   this because a critic in body and soul they will love to make use   of experiment in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense In   their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and   painful attempt than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic   century can approve ofThere is no doubt these coming one will be   least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous quality   which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty a to   standard of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method   the wary courage the standingalone and the capacity for   selfresponsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT   in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which know   how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds   They will be STERNER and perhaps not always towards themselves only   than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in   order that it may please them or elevate and inspire themthey   will rather have little faith in TRUTH bringing with it such revel   for the feeling They will smile those rigorous spirit when any one   say in their presence That thought elevates me why should it not be   true or That work enchants me why should it not be beautiful or   That artist enlarges me why should he not be great Perhaps they   will not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thus   rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one   could look into their inmost heart he would not easily find therein   the intention to reconcile Christian sentiment with antique taste   or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliation   necessarily found even among philosopher in our very uncertain and   consequently very conciliatory century Critical discipline and every   habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matter   will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosopher of   the future they may even make a display thereof a their special   adornmentnevertheless they will not want to be called critic on that   account It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to   have it decreed a is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is   criticism and critical scienceand nothing else whatever Though this   estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of   France and Germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste   of KANT let u call to mind the title of his principal work our new   philosopher will say notwithstanding that critic are instrument of   the philosopher and just on that account a instrument they are   far from being philosopher themselves Even the great Chinaman of   Konigsberg wa only a great critic     211 I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding   philosophical worker and in general scientific men with   philosophersthat precisely here one should strictly give each his   own and not give those far too much these far too little It may   be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself   should have once stood upon all those step upon which his servant   the scientific worker of philosophy remain standing and MUST remain   standing he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist   and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and   riddlereader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost   everything in order to traverse the whole range of human value   and estimation and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eye and   conscience to look from a height to any distance from a depth up   to any height from a nook into any expanse But all these are only   preliminary condition for his task this task itself demand something   elseit requires him TO CREATE VALUES The philosophical worker after   the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel have to fix and formalize some   great existing body of valuationsthat is to say former DETERMINATIONS   OF VALUE creation of value which have become prevalent and are for   a time called truthswhether in the domain of the LOGICAL the   POLITICAL moral or the ARTISTIC It is for these investigator to   make whatever ha happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous   conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long   even time itself and to SUBJUGATE the entire past an immense and   wonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride all   tenacious will can surely find satisfaction THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS   HOWEVER ARE COMMANDERS AND LAWGIVERS they say Thus SHALL it be   They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind and thereby   set aside the previous labour of all philosophical worker and all   subjugator of the pastthey grasp at the future with a creative   hand and whatever is and wa becomes for them thereby a mean an   instrument and a hammer Their knowing is CREATING their creating   is a lawgiving their will to truth isWILL TO POWERAre there at   present such philosopher Have there ever been such philosopher MUST   there not be such philosopher some day      212 It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher a a man   INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow ha ever   found himself and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself in contradiction   to the day in which he life his enemy ha always been the ideal of his   day Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one   call philosopherswho rarely regarded themselves a lover of wisdom   but rather a disagreeable fool and dangerous interrogatorshave found   their mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end   however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of   their age In putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the very   VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE they have betrayed their own secret it ha been   for the sake of a NEW greatness of man a new untrodden path to   his aggrandizement They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy   indolence selfindulgence and selfneglect how much falsehood wa   concealed under the most venerated type of contemporary morality how   much virtue wa OUTLIVED they have always said We must remove hence to   where YOU are least at home In the face of a world of modern idea   which would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty a   philosopher if there could be philosopher nowadays would be compelled   to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely   in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his allroundness he   would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety   of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the   EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the   taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is   so adapted to the spirit of the age a weakness of will consequently in   the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity   for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception   of greatness with a good a right a the opposite doctrine with it   ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity wa suited to   an opposite agesuch a the sixteenth century which suffered from it   accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrent and flood   of selfishness In the time of Socrates among men only of wornout   instinct old conservative Athenians who let themselves gofor the   sake of happiness a they said for the sake of pleasure a their   conduct indicatedand who had continually on their lip the old pompous   word to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led   IRONY wa perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked Socratic   assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his   own flesh a into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that   said plainly enough Do not dissemble before me herewe are equal   At present on the contrary when throughout Europe the herdinganimal   alone attains to honour and dispenses honour when equality of   right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrongI mean to   say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged   against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher   responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordlinessat present   it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to be   apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live   by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his   own ideal when he asserts He shall be the greatest who can be the most   solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good   and evil the master of his virtue and of superabundance of will   precisely this shall be called GREATNESS a diversified a can be   entire a ample a can be full And to ask once more the question Is   greatness POSSIBLEnowadays     213 It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it can not   be taught one must know it by experienceor one should have the   pride NOT to know it The fact that at present people all talk of thing   of which they CANNOT have any experience is true more especially   and unfortunately a concern the philosopher and philosophical   mattersthe very few know them are permitted to know them and   all popular idea about them are false Thus for instance the truly   philosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which run   at presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which make no   false step is unknown to most thinker and scholar from their own   experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their   presence it is incredible to them They conceive of every necessity a   troublesome a a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint   thinking itself is regarded by them a something slow and hesitating   almost a a trouble and often enough a worthy of the SWEAT of the   noblebut not at all a something easy and divine closely related   to dancing and exuberance To think and to take a matter seriously   arduouslythat is one and the same thing to them such only ha been   their experienceArtists have here perhaps a finer intuition they   who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything   arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom   of subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shaping   reach it climaxin short that necessity and freedom of will are   then the same thing with them There is in fine a gradation of rank   in psychical state to which the gradation of rank in the problem   corresponds and the highest problem repel ruthlessly every one who   venture too near them without being predestined for their solution   by the loftiness and power of his spirituality Of what use is it for   nimble everyday intellect or clumsy honest mechanic and empiricist   to press in their plebeian ambition close to such problem and a   it were into this holy of holiesas so often happens nowadays But   coarse foot must never tread upon such carpet this is provided for in   the primary law of thing the door remain closed to those intruder   though they may dash and break their head thereon People have always   to be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be BRED   for it a person ha only a right to philosophytaking the word in   it higher significancein virtue of his descent the ancestor the   blood decide here also Many generation must have prepared the way   for the coming of the philosopher each of his virtue must have been   separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the   bold easy delicate course and current of his thought but above all   the readiness for great responsibility the majesty of ruling glance   and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with   their duty and virtue the kindly patronage and defense of whatever   is misunderstood and calumniated be it God or devil the delight and   practice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude of   will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely look up rarely   love         CHAPTER VII OUR VIRTUES       214 OUR VirtuesIt is probable that we too have still our virtue   although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtue on   account of which we hold our grandfather in esteem and also at a little   distance from u We Europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlings   of the twentieth centurywith all our dangerous curiosity our   multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly   sweetened cruelty in sense and spiritwe shall presumably IF we must   have virtue have those only which have come to agreement with our most   secret and heartfelt inclination with our most ardent requirement   well then let u look for them in our labyrinthswhere a we know   so many thing lose themselves so many thing get quite lost And is   there anything finer than to SEARCH for one own virtue Is it not   almost to BELIEVE in one own virtue But this believing in one   own virtuesis it not practically the same a what wa formerly called   one good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea   which our grandfather used to hang behind their head and often enough   also behind their understanding It seems therefore that however   little we may imagine ourselves to be oldfashioned and grandfatherly   respectable in other respect in one thing we are nevertheless the   worthy grandchild of our grandfather we last Europeans with good   conscience we also still wear their pigtailAh if you only knew how   soon so very soonit will be different     215 As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two sun which   determine the path of one planet and in certain case sun of different   colour shine around a single planet now with red light now with   green and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley   colour so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our   firmament are determined by DIFFERENT morality our action shine   alternately in different colour and are seldom unequivocaland there   are often case also in which our action are MOTLEYCOLOURED     216 To love one enemy I think that ha been well learnt it take   place thousand of time at present on a large and small scale indeed   at time the higher and sublimer thing take placewe learn to DESPISE   when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however   unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and   secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word   and the formula of virtue Morality a attitudeis opposed to our taste   nowadays This is ALSO an advance a it wa an advance in our father   that religion a an attitude finally became opposed to their taste   including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion and all   that formerly belonged to freethinkerpantomime It is the music in our   conscience the dance in our spirit to which Puritan litany moral   sermon and goodygoodness wo nt chime     217 Let u be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance   to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment   They never forgive u if they have once made a mistake BEFORE u   or even with REGARD to usthey inevitably become our instinctive   calumniators and detractor even when they still remain our   friendsBlessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of   their blunder     218 The psychologist of Franceand where else are there still   psychologist nowadayshave never yet exhausted their bitter and   manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just a though in   short they betray something thereby Flaubert for instance the honest   citizen of Rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the   end it wa his mode of selftorment and refined cruelty As this is   growing wearisome I would now recommend for a change something else   for a pleasurenamely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat   honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirit and the task   they have to perform the subtle barbed Jesuitical astuteness which   is a thousand time subtler than the taste and understanding of the   middleclass in it best momentssubtler even than the understanding of   it victimsa repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent   of all kind of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered In   short you psychologist study the philosophy of the rule in it   struggle with the exception there you have a spectacle fit for Gods   and godlike malignity Or in plainer word practise vivisection on   good people on the homo bonae voluntatis ON YOURSELVES     219 The practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite   revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are le so it is   also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature   and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING   subtlemalice spiritualises They are glad in their inmost heart that   there is a standard according to which those who are overendowed with   intellectual good and privilege are equal to them they contend for   the equality of all before God and almost NEED the belief in God for   this purpose It is among them that the most powerful antagonist of   atheism are found If any one were to say to them A lofty spirituality   is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely   moral manit would make them furious I shall take care not to say   so I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality   itself exists only a the ultimate product of moral quality that it   is a synthesis of all quality attributed to the merely moral man   after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice   perhaps during a whole series of generation that lofty spirituality   is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severity   which know that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the   world even among thingsand not only among men     220 Now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular   one mustprobably not without some dangerget an idea of WHAT people   actually take an interest in and what are the thing generally which   fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary menincluding the   cultured even the learned and perhaps philosopher also if   appearance do not deceive The fact thereby becomes obvious that the   greater part of what interest and charm higher nature and more   refined and fastidious taste seems absolutely uninteresting to   the average manif notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these   interest he call it desinteresse and wonder how it is possible to   act disinterestedly There have been philosopher who could give this   popular astonishment a seductive and mystical otherworldly expression   perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience   instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that   disinterested action is very interesting and interested action   provided that And loveWhat Even an action for love sake   shall be unegoistic But you fool And the praise of the   selfsacrificerBut whoever ha really offered sacrifice know that   he wanted and obtained something for itperhaps something from himself   for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have   more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more   But this is a realm of question and answer in which a more fastidious   spirit doe not like to stay for here truth ha to stifle her yawn so   much when she is obliged to answer And after all truth is a woman one   must not use force with her     221 It sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant and   trifleretailer that I honour and respect an unselfish man not   however because he is unselfish but because I think he ha a right to   be useful to another man at his own expense In short the question   is always who HE is and who THE OTHER is For instance in a person   created and destined for command selfdenial and modest retirement   instead of being virtue would be the waste of virtue so it seems   to me Every system of unegoistic morality which take itself   unconditionally and appeal to every one not only sin against good   taste but is also an incentive to sin of omission an ADDITIONAL   seduction under the mask of philanthropyand precisely a seduction and   injury to the higher rarer and more privileged type of men Moral   system must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF   RANK their presumption must be driven home to their conscienceuntil   they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that what   is right for one is proper for anotherSo said my moralistic pedant   and bonhomme Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus   exhorted system of moral to practise morality But one should not be   too much in the right if one wish to have the laugher on ONES OWN   side a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste     222 Wherever sympathy fellowsuffering is preached nowadaysand   if I gather rightly no other religion is any longer preachedlet the   psychologist have his ear open through all the vanity through all the   noise which is natural to these preacher a to all preacher he will   hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of SELFCONTEMPT It belongs   to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe which ha been on   the increase for a century the first symptom of which are already   specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame   dEpinayIF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF The man of   modern idea the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied with   himselfthis is perfectly certain He suffers and his vanity want him   only to suffer with his fellow     223 The hybrid Europeana tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in   allabsolutely requires a costume he need history a a storeroom   of costume To be sure he notice that none of the costume fit him   properlyhe change and change Let u look at the nineteenth century   with respect to these hasty preference and change in it masquerade   of style and also with respect to it moment of desperation on account   of nothing suiting u It is in vain to get ourselves up a romantic   or classical or Christian or Florentine or barocco or national   in moribus et artibus it doe not clothe u But the spirit   especially the historical spirit profit even by this desperation   once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested   put on taken off packed up and above all studiedwe are the first   studious age in puncto of costume I mean a concern moral   article of belief artistic taste and religion we are prepared a   no other age ha ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the   most spiritual festivallaughter and arrogance for the transcendental   height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world Perhaps   we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the   domain where even we can still be original probably a parodist of   the world history and a Gods MerryAndrewsperhaps though nothing   else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a   future     224 The historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly   the order of rank of the valuation according to which a people a   community or an individual ha lived the divining instinct for the   relationship of these valuation for the relation of the authority   of the valuation to the authority of the operating forcesthis   historical sense which we Europeans claim a our specialty ha come   to u in the train of the enchanting and mad semibarbarity into which   Europe ha been plunged by the democratic mingling of class and   racesit is only the nineteenth century that ha recognized this   faculty a it sixth sense Owing to this mingling the past of every   form and mode of life and of culture which were formerly closely   contiguous and superimposed on one another flow forth into u modern   soul our instinct now run back in all direction we ourselves are   a kind of chaos in the end a we have said the spirit perceives it   advantage therein By mean of our semibarbarity in body and in desire   we have secret access everywhere such a a noble age never had we have   access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilization and to   every form of semibarbarity that ha at any time existed on earth and   in so far a the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto   ha just been semibarbarity the historical sense implies almost the   sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything   whereby it immediately prof itself to be an IGNOBLE sense For   instance we enjoy Homer once more it is perhaps our happiest   acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer whom men of   distinguished culture a the French of the seventeenth century like   SaintEvremond who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE and even   Voltaire the last echo of the century can not and could not so easily   appropriatewhom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy The very   decided Yea and Nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their   hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of   the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of   every distinguished and selfsufficing culture to avow a new desire   a dissatisfaction with it own condition or an admiration of what is   strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards   the best thing of the world which are not their property or could not   become their preyand no faculty is more unintelligible to such men   than just this historical sense with it truckling plebeian   curiosity The case is not different with Shakespeare that marvelous   SpanishMoorishSaxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient Athenian   of the circle of AEschylus would have halfkilled himself with laughter   or irritation but weaccept precisely this wild motleyness this   medley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificial   with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it a a refinement   of art reserved expressly for u and allow ourselves to be a little   disturbed by the repulsive fume and the proximity of the English   populace in which Shakespeares art and taste life a perhaps on   the Chiaja of Naples where with all our sens awake we go our way   enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drainodour of the lower   quarter of the town That a men of the historical sense we have   our virtue is not to be disputedwe are unpretentious unselfish   modest brave habituated to selfcontrol and selfrenunciation very   grateful very patient very complaisantbut with all this we are   perhaps not very tasteful Let u finally confess it that what is   most difficult for u men of the historical sense to grasp feel   taste and love what find u fundamentally prejudiced and almost   hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every   culture and art the essentially noble in work and men their moment   of smooth sea and halcyon selfsufficiency the goldenness and coldness   which all thing show that have perfected themselves Perhaps our great   virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste   at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves   imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and   happy godsend and glorification of human life a they shine here and   there those moment and marvelous experience when a great power ha   voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinitewhen a   superabundance of refined delight ha been enjoyed by a sudden checking   and petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still   trembling ground PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to u let u confess it   to ourselves our itching is really the itching for the infinite the   immeasurable Like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the   rein fall before the infinite we modern men we semibarbariansand   are only in OUR highest bliss when weARE IN MOST DANGER     225 Whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism   all those mode of thinking which measure the worth of thing according   to PLEASURE and PAIN that is according to accompanying circumstance   and secondary consideration are plausible mode of thought and   naivete which every one conscious of CREATIVE power and an artist   conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy   Sympathy for youto be sure that is not sympathy a you understand   it it is not sympathy for social distress for society with it   sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie   on the ground around u still le is it sympathy for the grumbling   vexed revolutionary slaveclasses who strive after powerthey call it   freedom OUR sympathy is a loftier and furthersighted sympathywe   see how MAN dwarf himself how YOU dwarf him and there are moment   when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist   itwhen we regard your seriousness a more dangerous than any kind   of levity You want if possibleand there is not a more foolish if   possibleTO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING and weit really seems that WE   would rather have it increased and made worse than it ha ever been   Wellbeing a you understand itis certainly not a goal it seems   to u an END a condition which at once render man ludicrous and   contemptibleand make his destruction DESIRABLE The discipline   of suffering of GREAT sufferingknow ye not that it is only THIS   discipline that ha produced all the elevation of humanity hitherto   The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it it energy   it shuddering in view of rack and ruin it inventiveness and bravery   in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and   whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness ha   been bestowed upon the soulhas it not been bestowed through suffering   through the discipline of great suffering In man CREATURE and CREATOR   are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire   folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness   of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh daydo   ye understand this contrast And that YOUR sympathy for the creature   in man applies to that which ha to be fashioned bruised forged   stretched roasted annealed refinedto that which must necessarily   SUFFER and IS MEANT to suffer And our sympathydo ye not understand   what our REVERSE sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy a   the worst of all pampering and enervationSo it is sympathy AGAINST   sympathyBut to repeat it once more there are higher problem than   the problem of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all system of   philosophy which deal only with these are naivete     226 WE IMMORALISTSThis world with which WE are concerned in which   we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of   delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every   respect captious insidious sharp and tenderyes it is well   protected from clumsy spectator and familiar curiosity We are   woven into a strong net and garment of duty and CANNOT disengage   ourselvesprecisely here we are men of duty even we Occasionally   it is true we dance in our chain and betwixt our sword it   is none the le true that more often we gnash our teeth under the   circumstance and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot But   do what we will fool and appearance say of u These are men WITHOUT   dutywe have always fool and appearance against u     227 Honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we can not rid   ourselves we free spiritswell we will labour at it with all our   perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in OUR   virtue which alone remains may it glance some day overspread like   a gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with it dull   gloomy seriousness And if nevertheless our honesty should one day   grow weary and sigh and stretch it limb and find u too hard and   would fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeable   vice let u remain HARD we latest Stoics and let u send to it   help whatever devilry we have in usour disgust at the clumsy   and undefined our NITIMUR IN VETITUM our love of adventure   our sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguised   intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest which ramble and   roves avidiously around all the realm of the futurelet u go with all   our devil to the help of our God It is probable that people will   misunderstand and mistake u on that account what doe it matter They   will say Their honestythat is their devilry and nothing else   What doe it matter And even if they were righthave not all Gods   hitherto been such sanctified rebaptized devil And after all what   do we know of ourselves And what the spirit that lead u want TO BE   CALLED It is a question of name And how many spirit we harbour   Our honesty we free spiritslet u be careful lest it become our   vanity our ornament and ostentation our limitation our stupidity   Every virtue incline to stupidity every stupidity to virtue stupid   to the point of sanctity they say in Russialet u be careful lest   out of pure honesty we eventually become saint and bore Is not life   a hundred time too short for usto bore ourselves One would have to   believe in eternal life in order to     228 I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy   hitherto ha been tedious and ha belonged to the soporific   appliancesand that virtue in my opinion ha been MORE injured   by the TEDIOUSNESS of it advocate than by anything else at the same   time however I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness It   is desirable that a few people a possible should reflect upon moral   and consequently it is very desirable that moral should not some day   become interesting But let u not be afraid Things still remain today   a they have always been I see no one in Europe who ha or DISCLOSES   an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning moral might be   conducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring mannerthat CALAMITY   might be involved therein Observe for example the indefatigable   inevitable English utilitarian how ponderously and respectably they   stalk on stalk along a Homeric metaphor express it better in the   footstep of Bentham just a he had already stalked in the footstep of   the respectable Helvetius no he wa not a dangerous man Helvetius   CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE to use an expression of Galiani No new   thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression   of an old thought not even a proper history of what ha been previously   thought on the subject an IMPOSSIBLE literature taking it all in all   unless one know how to leaven it with some mischief In effect the   old English vice called CANT which is MORAL TARTUFFISM ha insinuated   itself also into these moralist whom one must certainly read with an   eye to their motif if one MUST read them concealed this time under   the new form of the scientific spirit moreover there is not absent   from them a secret struggle with the pang of conscience from which a   race of former Puritans must naturally suffer in all their scientific   tinkering with moral Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan   That is to say a a thinker who regard morality a questionable   a worthy of interrogation in short a a problem Is moralizing   notimmoral In the end they all want English morality to be   recognized a authoritative inasmuch a mankind or the general   utility or the happiness of the greatest numberno the happiness   of ENGLAND will be best served thereby They would like by all mean   to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness I   mean after COMFORT and FASHION and in the highest instance a seat in   Parliament is at the same time the true path

grasped but is only a   nostrumthat what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another   that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to   higher men in short that there is a

later age which may be proud of their humanity there   still remains so much fear so much SUPERSTITION of the fear of the   cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of   these humaner agesthat even obvious truth a if by the agreement   of century have long remained unuttered because they have the   appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again   I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape let   others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment   FOOTNOTE An expression from Schillers William Tell Act IV Scene   3 to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in it old   cornerOne ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one eye   one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest   gross errorsas for instance have been fostered by ancient and   modern philosopher with regard to tragedymay no longer wander about   virtuously and boldly Almost everything that we call higher culture   is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTYthis is   my thesis the wild beast ha not been slain at all it life it   flourish it ha only beentransfigured That which constitutes the   painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in   socalled tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime   up to the highest and most delicate thrill of metaphysics obtains it   sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty What the   Roman enjoys in the arena the Christian in the ecstasy of the cross   the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bullfight   the presentday Japanese who press his way to the tragedy the workman   of the Parisian suburb who ha a homesickness for bloody revolution   the Wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance of   Tristan and Isoldewhat all these enjoy and strive with mysterious   ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great Circe cruelty Here   to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of   former time which could only teach with regard to cruelty that   it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS there is an   abundant superabundant enjoyment even in one own suffering in   causing one own sufferingand wherever man ha allowed himself to be   persuaded to selfdenial in the RELIGIOUS sense or to selfmutilation   a among the Phoenicians and ascetic or in general to   desensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to Puritanical   repentancespasms to vivisection of conscience and to Pascallike   SACRIFIZIA DELL INTELLETO he is secretly allured and impelled   forward by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS   HIMSELFFinally let u consider that even the seeker of knowledge   operates a an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels his   spirit to perceive AGAINST it own inclination and often enough against   the wish of his hearthe force it to say Nay where he would like   to affirm love and adore indeed every instance of taking a thing   profoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuring   of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aim at   appearance and superficialityeven in every desire for knowledge there   is a drop of cruelty     230 Perhaps what I have said here about a fundamental will of the   spirit may not be understood without further detail I may be allowed   a word of explanationThat imperious something which is popularly   called the spirit wish to be master internally and externally   and to feel itself master it ha the will of a multiplicity for a   simplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will   Its requirement and capacity here are the same a those assigned by   physiologist to everything that life grows and multiplies The power   of the spirit to appropriate foreign element reveals itself in a strong   tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifold   to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just a it   arbitrarily reunderlines make prominent and falsifies for itself   certain trait and line in the foreign element in every portion of   the outside world Its object thereby is the incorporation of new   experience the assortment of new thing in the old arrangementsin   short growth or more properly the FEELING of growth the feeling of   increased poweris it object This same will ha at it service an   apparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preference   of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of window an inner   denial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensive   attitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscurity   with the shuttingin horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance   a that which is all necessary according to the degree of it   appropriating power it digestive power to speak figuratively and   in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else Here   also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be   deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so   but is only allowed to pas a such a delight in uncertainty and   ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary outoftheway narrowness   and mystery of the toonear of the foreground of the magnified   the diminished the misshapen the beautifiedan enjoyment of the   arbitrariness of all these manifestation of power Finally in this   connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to   deceive other spirit and dissemble before themthe constant pressing   and straining of a creating shaping changeable power the spirit   enjoys therein it craftiness and it variety of disguise it enjoys   also it feeling of security thereinit is precisely by it Protean   art that it is best protected and concealedCOUNTER TO this   propensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for a   cloak in short for an outsidefor every outside is a cloakthere   operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which take and   INSISTS on taking thing profoundly variously and thoroughly a a   kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every   courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided a it ought   to be that he ha sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for   introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe   word He will say There is something cruel in the tendency of my   spirit let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not   so In fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps   our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and   glorifiedwe free VERY free spiritsand some day perhaps SUCH will   actually be ourposthumous glory Meanwhilefor there is plenty of   time until thenwe should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in   such florid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work ha   just made u sick of this taste and it sprightly exuberance They are   beautiful glistening jingling festive word honesty love of truth   love of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthfulthere   is something in them that make one heart swell with pride But we   anchorite and marmot have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the   secrecy of an anchorite conscience that this worthy parade of   verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and   golddust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such   flattering colour and repainting the terrible original text HOMO NATURA   must again be recognized In effect to translate man back again into   nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretation and   subordinate meaning which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over   the eternal original text HOMO NATURA to bring it about that man shall   henceforth stand before man a he now hardened by the discipline   of science stand before the OTHER form of nature with fearless   Oedipuseyes and stopped Ulyssesears deaf to the enticement of old   metaphysical birdcatchers who have piped to him far too long Thou   art more thou art higher thou hast a different originthis may be   a strange and foolish task but that it is a TASK who can deny Why did   we choose it this foolish task Or to put the question differently   Why knowledge at all Every one will ask u about this And thus   pressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred time have   not found and can not find any better answer     231 Learning alters u it doe what all nourishment doe that doe not   merely conserveas the physiologist know But at the bottom of our   soul quite down below there is certainly something unteachable   a granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to   predetermined chosen question In each cardinal problem there speaks   an unchangeable I am this a thinker can not learn anew about man and   woman for instance but can only learn fullyhe can only follow to the   end what is fixed about them in himself Occasionally we find certain   solution of problem which make strong belief for u perhaps they   are henceforth called conviction Later onone see in them only   footstep to selfknowledge guidepost to the problem which we   ourselves AREor more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody   our spiritual fate the UNTEACHABLE in u quite down belowIn view   of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself permission   will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truth about   woman a she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally   they are merelyMY truth     232 Woman wish to be independent and therefore she begin to   enlighten men about woman a she isTHIS is one of the worst   development of the general UGLIFYING of Europe For what must these   clumsy attempt of feminine scientificality and selfexposure bring   to light Woman ha so much cause for shame in woman there is so   much pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumption   unbridledness and indiscretion concealedstudy only woman behaviour   towards childrenwhich ha really been best restrained and dominated   hitherto by the FEAR of man Alas if ever the eternally tedious in   womanshe ha plenty of itis allowed to venture forth if she   begin radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and artof   charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and   taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable   desire Female voice are already raised which by Saint Aristophanes   make one afraidwith medical explicitness it is stated in a   threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man Is   it not in the very worst taste that woman thus set herself up to be   scientific Enlightenment hitherto ha fortunately been men affair   men giftwe remained therewith among ourselves and in the end   in view of all that woman write about woman we may well have   considerable doubt a to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment   about herselfand CAN desire it If woman doe not thereby seek a new   ORNAMENT for herselfI believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally   femininewhy then she wish to make herself feared perhaps she   thereby wish to get the mastery But she doe not want truthwhat   doe woman care for truth From the very first nothing is more foreign   more repugnant or more hostile to woman than truthher great art is   falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty Let u confess   it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in   woman we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek the   company of being under whose hand glance and delicate folly our   seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like folly to   u Finally I ask the question Did a woman herself ever acknowledge   profundity in a woman mind or justice in a woman heart And is it   not true that on the whole woman ha hitherto been most despised by   woman herself and not at all by usWe men desire that woman should   not continue to compromise herself by enlightening u just a it wa   man care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed   mulier taceat in ecclesia It wa to the benefit of woman when Napoleon   gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand mulier taceat in   politicisand in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who call   out to woman today mulier taceat de mulierel     233 It betrays corruption of the instinctsapart from the fact that   it betrays bad tastewhen a woman refers to Madame Roland or Madame de   Stael or Monsieur George Sand a though something were proved thereby   in favour of woman a she is Among men these are the three comical   woman a they arenothing moreand just the best involuntary   counterargument against feminine emancipation and autonomy     234 Stupidity in the kitchen woman a cook the terrible   thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of   the house is managed Woman doe not understand what food mean and she   insists on being cook If woman had been a thinking creature she should   certainly a cook for thousand of year have discovered the most   important physiological fact and should likewise have got possession   of the healing art Through bad female cooksthrough the entire lack   of reason in the kitchenthe development of mankind ha been longest   retarded and most interfered with even today matter are very little   better A word to High School girl     235 There are turn and cast of fancy there are sentence little   handful of word in which a whole culture a whole society suddenly   crystallises itself Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de   Lambert to her son MON AMI NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES   QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIRthe motherliest and wisest remark by   the way that wa ever addressed to a son     236 I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and   Goethe believed about womanthe former when he sang ELLA GUARDAVA   SUSO ED IO IN LEI and the latter when he interpreted it the   eternally feminine draw u ALOFT for THIS is just what she belief   of the eternally masculine     237     SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN     How the longest ennui flees When a man come to our knee

treated by men like bird which losing   their way have come down among them from an elevation a something   delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animatingbut a something   also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away     238 To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman to   deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally   hostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal right equal   training equal claim and obligation that is a TYPICAL sign of   shallowmindedness and a thinker who ha proved himself shallow at   this dangerous spotshallow in instinctmay generally be regarded a   suspicious nay more a betrayed a discovered he will probably prove   too short for all fundamental question of life future a well a   present and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depth On the   other hand a man who ha depth of spirit a well a of desire and   ha also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and   harshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman a   ORIENTALS do he must conceive of her a a possession a confinable   property a a being predestined for service and accomplishing her   mission thereinhe must take his stand in this matter upon the immense   rationality of Asia upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia a   the Greeks did formerly those best heir and scholar of Asiawho   a is well known with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power   from Homer to the time of Pericles became gradually STRICTER towards   woman in short more Oriental HOW necessary HOW logical even HOW   humanely desirable this wa let u consider for ourselves     239 The weaker sex ha in no previous age been treated with so   much respect by men a at presentthis belongs to the tendency and   fundamental taste of democracy in the same way a disrespectfulness to   old agewhat wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of   this respect They want more they learn to make claim the tribute   of respect is at last felt to be wellnigh galling rivalry for right   indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in a word woman is   losing modesty And let u immediately add that she is also losing   taste She is unlearning to FEAR man but the woman who unlearns to   fear sacrifice her most womanly instinct That woman should venture   forward when the fearinspiring quality in manor more definitely   the MAN in manis no longer either desired or fully developed is   reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difficult   to understand is that precisely therebywoman deteriorates This is   what is happening nowadays let u not deceive ourselves about it   Wherever the industrial spirit ha triumphed over the military   and aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legal   independence of a clerk woman a clerkess is inscribed on the portal   of the modern society which is in course of formation While she   thus appropriates new right aspires to be master and inscribes   progress of woman on her flag and banner the very opposite realises   itself with terrible obviousness WOMAN RETROGRADES Since the French   Revolution the influence of woman in Europe ha DECLINED in proportion   a she ha increased her right and claim and the emancipation of   woman insofar a it is desired and demanded by woman themselves and   not only by masculine shallowpates thus prof to be a remarkable   symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly   instinct There is STUPIDITY in this movement an almost masculine   stupidity of which a wellreared womanwho is always a sensible   womanmight be heartily ashamed To lose the intuition a to the ground   upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in   the use of her proper weapon to letherselfgo before man perhaps   even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in   refined artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man   faith in a VEILED fundamentally different ideal in woman something   eternally necessarily feminine to emphatically and loquaciously   dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared for   protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and   often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of   everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of   woman in the hitherto existing order of society ha entailed and still   entail a though slavery were a counterargument and not rather a   condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culturewhat   doe all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instinct   a defeminising Certainly there are enough of idiotic friend and   corrupters of woman among the learned ass of the masculine sex who   advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate   all the stupidity from which man in Europe European manliness   sufferswho would like to lower woman to general culture indeed   even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics Here and there   they wish even to make woman into free spirit and literary worker a   though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious   or ludicrous to a profound and godless manalmost everywhere her   nerve are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music   our latest German music and she is daily being made more hysterical   and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that of   bearing robust child They wish to cultivate her in general still   more and intend a they say to make the weaker sex STRONG by   culture a if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that   the cultivating of mankind and his weakeningthat is to say the   weakening dissipating and languishing of his FORCE OF WILLhave   always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and   influential woman in the world and lastly the mother of Napoleon   had just to thank their force of willand not their schoolmastersfor   their power and ascendancy over men That which inspires respect   in woman and often enough fear also is her NATURE which is more   natural than that of man her genuine carnivoralike cunning   flexibility her tigerclaws beneath the glove her NAIVETE in egoism   her untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensibleness   extent and deviation of her desire and virtue That which in spite   of fear excites one sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat   woman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable more   necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any   other creature Fear and sympathy it is with these feeling that man ha   hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in   tragedy which rends while it delightsWhat And all that is now to   be at an end And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress The   tediousness of woman is slowly evolving Oh Europe Europe We know   the horned animal which wa always most attractive to thee from which   danger is ever again threatening thee Thy old fable might once more   become historyan immense stupidity might once again overmaster   thee and carry thee away And no God concealed beneath itno only an   idea a modern idea         CHAPTER VIII PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES       240 I HEARD once again for the first time Richard Wagners overture   to the Mastersinger it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavy   latterday art which ha the pride to presuppose two century of music   a still living in order that it may be understoodit is an honour   to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate What flavour   and force what season and clime do we not find mingled in it It   impress u at one time a ancient at another time a foreign bitter   and too modern it is a arbitrary a it is pompously traditional it   is not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarseit ha fire   and courage and at the same time the loose duncoloured skin of fruit   which ripen too late It flow broad and full and suddenly there is a   moment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that open between cause   and effect an oppression that make u dream almost a nightmare but   already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delightthe most   manifold delightof old and new happiness including ESPECIALLY   the joy of the artist in himself which he refuse to conceal his   astonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedient here   employed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedient of art   which he apparently betrays to u All in all however no beauty no   South nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothing   of grace no dance hardly a will to logic a certain clumsiness even   which is also emphasized a though the artist wished to say to u It   is part of my intention a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarily   barbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceit   and witticism something German in the best and worst sense of   the word something in the German style manifold formless and   inexhaustible a certain German potency and superplenitude of   soul which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of   decadencewhich perhaps feel itself most at ease there a real   genuine token of the German soul which is at the same time young and   aged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity This kind of music   express best what I think of the Germans they belong to the day   before yesterday and the day after tomorrowTHEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY     241 We good Europeans we also have hour when we allow ourselves a   warmhearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old love and narrow   viewsI have just given an example of ithours of national excitement   of patriotic anguish and all other sort of oldfashioned flood of   sentiment Duller spirit may perhaps only get done with what confines   it operation in u to hour and play itself out in hoursin a   considerable time some in half a year others in half a lifetime   according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change   their material Indeed I could think of sluggish hesitating race   which even in our rapidly moving Europe would require half a century   ere they could surmount such atavistic attack of patriotism and   soilattachment and return once more to reason that is to say to   good Europeanism And while digressing on this possibility I   happen to become an earwitness of a conversation between two old   patriotsthey were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently   spoke all the louder HE ha a much and know a much philosophy a   a peasant or a corpsstudent said the onehe is still innocent But   what doe that matter nowadays It is the age of the mass they lie on   their belly before everything that is massive And so also in politicis   A statesman who rear up for them a new Tower of Babel some monstrosity   of empire and power they call greatwhat doe it matter that we more   prudent and conservative one do not meanwhile give up the old belief   that it is only the great thought that give greatness to an action or   affair Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position   of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which they   were by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would have   to sacrifice their old and reliable virtue out of love to a new and   doubtful mediocritysupposing a statesman were to condemn his people   generally to practise politics when they have hitherto had something   better to do and think about and when in the depth of their soul   they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of   the restlessness emptiness and noisy wrangling of the essentially   politicspractising nationssupposing such a statesman were to   stimulate the slumbering passion and avidity of his people were to   make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness   an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were to   depreciate their most radical proclivity subvert their conscience   make their mind narrow and their taste nationalwhat a statesman   who should do all this which his people would have to do penance for   throughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesman   would be GREAT would heUndoubtedly replied the other old patriot   vehemently otherwise he COULD NOT have done it It wa mad perhaps to   wish such a thing But perhaps everything great ha been just a mad   at it commencementMisuse of word cried his interlocutor   contradictorilystrong strong Strong and mad NOT greatThe old   men had obviously become heated a they thus shouted their truth in   each others face but I in my happiness and apartness considered how   soon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also that   there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a   nationnamely in the deepening of another     242 Whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress   which now distinguishes the European whether we call it simply without   praise or blame by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in   Europebehind all the moral and political foreground pointed to by   such formula an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS go on which is ever   extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans their   increasing detachment from the condition under which climatically and   hereditarily united race originate their increasing independence of   every definite milieu that for century would fain inscribe itself   with equal demand on soul and bodythat is to say the slow emergence   of an essentially SUPERNATIONAL and nomadic specie of man who   posse physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and power   of adaptation a his typical distinction This process of the EVOLVING   EUROPEAN which can be retarded in it TEMPO by great relapse but   will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depththe   stillraging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it   and also the anarchism which is appearing at presentthis process   will probably arrive at result on which it naive propagator and   panegyrist the apostle of modern idea would least care to reckon   The same new condition under which on an average a levelling and   mediocrising of man will take placea useful industrious variously   serviceable and clever gregarious manare in the highest degree   suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and   attractive quality For while the capacity for adaptation which is   every day trying changing condition and begin a new work with every   generation almost with every decade make the POWERFULNESS of the type   impossible while the collective impression of such future Europeans   will probably be that of numerous talkative weakwilled and very   handy workman who REQUIRE a master a commander a they require their   daily bread while therefore the democratising of Europe will tend to   the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle   sense of the term the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and   exceptional case become stronger and richer than he ha perhaps ever   been beforeowing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to   the immense variety of practice art and disguise I meant to say   that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary   arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTStaking the word in all it   meaning even in it most spiritual sense     243 I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the   constellation Hercules and I hope that the men on this earth will do   like the sun And we foremost we good Europeans     244 There wa a time when it wa customary to call Germans deep   by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new   Germanism is covetous of quite other honour and perhaps miss   smartness in all that ha depth it is almost opportune and patriotic   to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that   commendation in short whether German depth is not at bottom something   different and worseand something from which thank God we are on the   point of successfully ridding ourselves Let u try then to relearn   with regard to German depth the only thing necessary for the purpose is   a little vivisection of the German soulThe German soul is above all   manifold varied in it source aggregated and superimposed rather   than actually built this is owing to it origin A German who would   embolden himself to assert Two soul ala dwell in my breast would   make a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far   short of the truth about the number of soul As a people made up of   the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of race perhaps even with a   preponderance of the preAryan element a the people of the centre in   every sense of the term the Germans are more intangible more ample   more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising   and even more terrifying than other people are to themselvesthey   escape DEFINITION and are thereby alone the despair of the French It   IS characteristic of the Germans that the question What is German   never dy out among them Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well   enough We are known they cried jubilantly to himbut Sand also   thought he knew them Jean Paul knew what he wa doing when he declared   himself incensed at Fichtes lying but patriotic flattery and   exaggerationsbut it is probable that Goethe thought differently about   Germans from Jean Paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with   regard to Fichte It is a question what Goethe really thought about the   GermansBut about many thing around him he never spoke explicitly   and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silenceprobably he   had good reason for it It is certain that it wa not the Wars of   Independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it wa   the French Revolutionthe event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED   his Faust and indeed the whole problem of man wa the appearance   of Napoleon There are word of Goethe in which he condemns with   impatient severity a from a foreign land that which Germans take a   pride in he once defined the famous German turn of mind a Indulgence   towards it own and others weakness Was he wrong it is   characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them   The German soul ha passage and gallery in it there are cave   hidingplaces and dungeon therein it disorder ha much of the charm   of the mysterious the German is well acquainted with the bypath to   chaos And a everything love it symbol so the German love the   cloud and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and   shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped   selfdisplacing and growing is deep The German himself doe not   EXIST he is BECOMING he is developing himself Development is   therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain   of philosophical formulasa ruling idea which together with German   beer and German music is labouring to Germanise all Europe Foreigners   are astonished and attracted by the riddle which the conflicting nature   at the basis of the German soul propounds to them riddle which   Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner ha in the end set to music   Goodnatured and spitefulsuch a juxtaposition preposterous in the   case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justified   in Germany one ha only to live for a while among Swabians to know this   The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness   agree alarmingly well with his physical ropedancing and nimble   boldness of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid If any one   wish to see the German soul demonstrated ad oculos let him   only look at German taste at German art and manner what boorish   indifference to taste How the noblest and the commonest stand there   in juxtaposition How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution   of this soul The German DRAGS at his soul he drag at everything he   experience He digest his event badly he never get done   with them and German depth is often only a difficult hesitating   digestion And just a all chronic invalid all dyspeptic like what   is convenient so the German love frankness and honesty it is   so CONVENIENT to be frank and honestThis confidingness this   complaisance this showingthecards of German HONESTY is probably the   most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to   nowadays it is his proper Mephistophelean art with this he can still   achieve much The German let himself go and thereby gaze with   faithful blue empty German eyesand other country immediately   confound him with his dressinggownI meant to say that let German   depth be what it willamong ourselves alone we perhaps take the   liberty to laugh at itwe shall do well to continue henceforth to   honour it appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our   old reputation a a people of depth for Prussian smartness and   Berlin wit and sand It is wise for a people to pose and LET itself   be regarded a profound clumsy goodnatured honest and foolish it   might even beprofound to do so Finally we should do honour to   our namewe are not called the TIUSCHE VOLK deceptive people for   nothing     245 The good old time is past it sang itself out in Mozarthow   happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to u that his good   company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the Chinese and   it flourish his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant the   amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the South can   still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in u Ah some time or other it will be   over with itbut who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with   the intelligence and taste for Beethoven For he wa only the last echo   of a break and transition in style and NOT like Mozart the last echo   of a great European taste which had existed for century Beethoven   is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly   breaking down and a future overyoung soul that is always COMING   there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal   extravagant hopethe same light in which Europe wa bathed when it   dreamed with Rousseau when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the   Revolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon   But how rapidly doe THIS very sentiment now pale how difficult   nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment how strangely doe   the language of Rousseau Schiller Shelley and Byron sound to our ear   in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe wa able to SPEAK which   knew how to SING in BeethovenWhatever German music came afterwards   belongs to Romanticism that is to say to a movement which   historically considered wa still shorter more fleeting and more   superficial than that great interlude the transition of Europe from   Rousseau to Napoleon and to the rise of democracy Weberbut what do   WE care nowadays for Freischutz and Oberon Or Marschners Hans   Heiling and Vampyre Or even Wagners Tannhauser That is extinct   although not yet forgotten music This whole music of Romanticism   besides wa not noble enough wa not musical enough to maintain it   position anywhere but in the theatre and before the mass from the   beginning it wa secondrate music which wa little thought of by   genuine musician It wa different with Felix Mendelssohn that halcyon   master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly   acquired admiration and wa equally quickly forgotten a the beautiful   EPISODE of German music But with regard to Robert Schumann who took   thing seriously and ha been taken seriously from the firsthe   wa the last that founded a schooldo we not now regard it a a   satisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very Romanticism   of Schumanns ha been surmounted Schumann fleeing into the Saxon   Switzerland of his soul with a half Wertherlike half JeanPaullike   nature assuredly not like Beethoven assuredly not like Byronhis   MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of   injustice Schumann with his taste which wa fundamentally a PETTY   taste that is to say a dangerous propensitydoubly dangerous among   Germansfor quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feeling going   constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling who   revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning   a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGEREthis Schumann wa already merely a   GERMAN event in music and no longer a European event a Beethoven had   been a in a still greater degree Mozart had been with Schumann German   music wa threatened with it greatest danger that of LOSING THE VOICE   FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair     246 What a torture are book written in German to a reader who ha a   THIRD ear How indignantly he stand beside the slowly turning swamp   of sound without tune and rhythm without dance which Germans call   a book And even the German who READS book How lazily how   reluctantly how badly he read How many Germans know and consider it   obligatory to know that there is ART in every good sentenceart which   must be divined if the sentence is to be understood If there is a   misunderstanding about it TEMPO for instance the sentence itself   is misunderstood That one must not be doubtful about the   rhythmdetermining syllable that one should feel the breaking of the   toorigid symmetry a intentional and a a charm that one should lend a   fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO that one should   divine the sense in the sequence of the vowel and diphthong and how   delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of   their arrangementwho among bookreading Germans is complaisant enough   to recognize such duty and requirement and to listen to so much art   and intention in language After all one just ha no ear for it   and so the most marked contrast of style are not heard and the most   delicate artistry is a it were SQUANDERED on the deafThese were my   thought when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two master in   the art of prosewriting have been confounded one whose word drop   down hesitatingly and coldly a from the roof of a damp cavehe count   on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language   like a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toe feel the   dangerous bliss of the quivering oversharp blade which wish to   bite hiss and cut     247 How little the German style ha to do with harmony and with the   ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musician themselves   write badly The German doe not read aloud he doe not read for the   ear but only with his eye he ha put his ear away in the drawer for   the time In antiquity when a man readwhich wa seldom enoughhe read   something to himself and in a loud voice they were surprised when   any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it In a   loud voice that is to say with all the swelling inflection and   variation of key and change of TEMPO in which the ancient PUBLIC   world took delight The law of the written style were then the same   a those of the spoken style and these law depended partly on the   surprising development and refined requirement of the ear and larynx   partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lung In   the ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuch   a it is comprised in one breath Such period a occur in Demosthenes   and Cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath   were pleasure to the men of ANTIQUITY who knew by their own schooling   how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficulty   in the deliverance of such a periodWE have really no right to the   BIG period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense Those   ancient indeed were all of them dilettante in speaking consequently   connoisseur consequently criticsthey thus brought their orator to   the highest pitch in the same manner a in the last century when all   Italian lady and gentleman knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song   and with it also the art of melody reached it elevation In Germany   however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began   shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter it young wing there wa   properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical   discoursethat delivered from the pulpit The preacher wa the only one   in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner a   sentence strike spring rush flow and come to a close he alone   had a conscience in his ear often enough a bad conscience for reason   are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom   attained by a German or almost always too late The masterpiece of   German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of it   greatest preacher the BIBLE ha hitherto been the best German   book Compared with Luthers Bible almost everything else is merely   literaturesomething which ha not grown in Germany and therefore   ha not taken and doe not take root in German heart a the Bible ha   done     248 There are two kind of genius one which above all engenders and   seek to engender and another which willingly let itself be fructified   and brings forth And similarly among the gifted nation there are   those on whom the woman problem of pregnancy ha devolved and the   secret task of forming maturing and perfectingthe Greeks for   instance were a nation of this kind and so are the French and others   which have to fructify and become the cause of new mode of lifelike   the Jews the Romans and in all modesty be it asked like the   Germansnations tortured and enraptured by unknown fever and   irresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing for   foreign race for such a let themselves be fructified and withal   imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force   and consequently empowered by the grace of God These two kind of   genius seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand   each otherlike man and woman     249 Every nation ha it own Tartuffery and call that it   virtueOne doe not knowcannot know the best that is in one     250 What Europe owes to the JewsMany thing good and bad and above   all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand   style in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demand of   infinite signification the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral   questionablenessand consequently just the most attractive ensnaring   and exquisite element in those iridescence and allurement to life   in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture it evening   sky now glowsperhaps glow out For this we artist among the   spectator and philosopher aregrateful to the Jews     251 It must be taken into the bargain if various cloud and   disturbancesin short slight attack of stupiditypass over the   spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national   nervous fever and political ambition for instance among presentday   Germans there is alternately the antiFrench folly the antiSemitic   folly the antiPolish folly the Christianromantic folly the   Wagnerian folly the Teutonic folly the Prussian folly just look at   those poor historian the Sybels and Treitschkes and their closely   bandaged head and whatever else these little obscurations of the   German spirit and conscience may be called May it be forgiven me that   I too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not   remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began   to entertain thought about matter which did not concern methe first   symptom of political infection About the Jews for instance listen   to the followingI have never yet met a German who wa favourably   inclined to the Jews and however decided the repudiation of actual   antiSemitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men this   prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the   sentiment itself but only against it dangerous excess and especially   against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of   sentimenton this point we must not deceive ourselves That Germany   ha amply SUFFICIENT Jews that the German stomach the German blood   ha difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of this   quantity of Jewas the Italian the Frenchman and the Englishman   have done by mean of a stronger digestionthat is the unmistakable   declaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listen   and according to which one must act Let no more Jews come in And shut   the door especially towards the East also towards Austriathus   command the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and   uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by   a stronger race The Jews however are beyond all doubt the strongest   toughest and purest race at present living in Europe they know how   to succeed even under the worst condition in fact better than under   favourable one by mean of virtue of some sort which one would like   nowadays to label a vicesowing above all to a resolute faith which   doe not need to be ashamed before modern idea they alter only   WHEN they do alter in the same way that the Russian Empire make   it conquestas an empire that ha plenty of time and is not of   yesterdaynamely according to the principle a slowly a possible   A thinker who ha the future of Europe at heart will in all his   perspective concerning the future calculate upon the Jews a he   will calculate upon the Russians a above all the surest and likeliest   factor in the great play and battle of force That which is at present   called a nation in Europe and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA   indeed sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA is in   every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet   a race much le such a race AERE PERENNUS a the Jews are such   nation should most carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and   hostility It is certain that the Jews if they desiredor if they   were driven to it a the antiSemites seem to wishCOULD now have the   ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over Europe that they are NOT   working and planning for that end is equally certain Meanwhile they   rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and   absorbed by Europe they long to be finally settled authorized and   respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the   wandering Jewand one should certainly take account of this impulse   and tendency and MAKE ADVANCES to it it possibly betokens a mitigation   of the Jewish instinct for which purpose it would perhaps be useful   and fair to banish the antiSemitic bawler out of the country One   should make advance with all prudence and with selection pretty much   a the English nobility do It stand to reason that the more powerful   and strongly marked type of new Germanism could enter into relation   with the Jews with the least hesitation for instance the nobleman   officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many way   to see whether the genius for money and patience and especially some   intellect and intellectualitysadly lacking in the place referred to   could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of   commanding and obeyingfor both of which the country in question ha   now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal   discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my   SERIOUS TOPIC the European problem a I understand it the rearing   of a new ruling caste for Europe     252 They are not a philosophical racethe English Bacon represents an   ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally Hobbes Hume and Locke   an abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more   than a century It wa AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself   it wa Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said JE MEPRISE LOCKE in the   struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world   Hegel and Schopenhauer along with Goethe were of one accord the   two hostile brothergeniuses in philosophy who pushed in different   direction towards the opposite pole of German thought and thereby   wronged each other a only brother will doWhat is lacking in   England and ha always been lacking that halfactor and rhetorician   knew well enough the absurd muddlehead Carlyle who sought to conceal   under passionate grimace what he knew about himself namely what wa   LACKING in Carlylereal POWER of intellect real DEPTH of intellectual   perception in short philosophy It is characteristic of such an   unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianitythey NEED it   discipline for moralizing and humanizing The Englishman more gloomy   sensual headstrong and brutal than the Germanis for that very   reason a the baser of the two also the most pious he ha all the   MORE NEED of Christianity To finer nostril this English Christianity   itself ha still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic   excess for which owing to good reason it is used a an antidotethe   finer poison to neutralize the coarser a finer form of poisoning is   in fact a step in advance with coarsemannered people a step towards   spiritualization The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still   most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime and by praying   and psalmsinging or more correctly it is thereby explained and   differently expressed and for the herd of drunkard and rake who   formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism and   more recently a the Salvation Army a penitential fit may really be   the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can   be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted That however which   offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music to speak   figuratively and also literally he ha neither rhythm nor dance in   the movement of his soul and body indeed not even the desire for   rhythm and dance for music Listen to him speaking look at the most   beautiful Englishwoman WALKINGin no country on earth are there more   beautiful dove and swan finally listen to them singing But I ask   too much     253 There are truth which are best recognized by mediocre mind   because they are best adapted for them there are truth which only   posse charm and seductive power for mediocre spiritsone is pushed   to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence of   respectable but mediocre EnglishmenI may mention Darwin John   Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencerbegins to gain the ascendancy in the   middleclass region of European taste Indeed who could doubt that it   is a useful thing for SUCH mind to have the ascendancy for a time It   would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently   soaring mind a specially qualified for determining and collecting many   little common fact and deducing conclusion from them a exception   they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards   those who are the rule After all they have more to do than merely   to perceivein effect they have to BE something new they have to   SIGNIFY something new they have to REPRESENT new value The gulf   between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more   mysterious than one think the capable man in the grand style the   creator will possibly have to be an ignorant personwhile on the   other hand for scientific discovery like those of Darwin a certain   narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something   English may not be unfavourable for arriving at themFinally let   it not be forgotten that the English with their profound mediocrity   brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence     What is called modern idea or the idea of the eighteenth century   or French ideasthat consequently against which the GERMAN mind   rose up with profound disgustis of English origin there is no doubt   about it The French were only the ape and actor of these idea their   best soldier and likewise ala their first and profoundest VICTIMS   for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of modern idea the AME   FRANCAIS ha in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present   one recall it sixteenth and seventeenth century it profound   passionate strength it inventive excellency almost with disbelief   One must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in   a determined manner and defend it against present prejudice and   appearance the European NOBLESSEof sentiment taste and manner   taking the word in every high senseis the work and invention of   FRANCE the European ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideasis   ENGLANDS work and invention     254 Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual   and refined culture of Europe it is still the high school of taste but   one must know how to find this France of taste He who belongs to it   keep himself well concealedthey may be a small number in whom it   life and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon   the strongest leg in part fatalist hypochondriac invalid in   part person overindulged overrefined such a have the AMBITION to   conceal themselves     They have all something in common they keep their ear closed in   presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic   BOURGEOIS In fact a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawl   in the foregroundit recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste   and at the same time of selfadmiration at the funeral of Victor Hugo   There is also something else common to them a predilection to resist   intellectual Germanizingand a still greater inability to do so   In this France of intellect which is also a France of pessimism   Schopenhauer ha perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than   he ha ever been in Germany not to speak of Heinrich Heine who ha   long ago been reincarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrist   of Paris or of Hegel who at present in the form of Tainethe FIRST   of living historiansexercises an almost tyrannical influence As   regard Richard Wagner however the more French music learns to   adapt itself to the actual need of the AME MODERNE the more will it   Wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehandit is already   taking place sufficiently There are however three thing which the   French can still boast of with pride a their heritage and possession   and a indelible token of their ancient intellectual superiority   in Europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and   vulgarizing of taste FIRSTLY the capacity for artistic emotion for   devotion to form for which the expression LART POUR LART along   with numerous others ha been inventedsuch capacity ha not been   lacking in France for three century and owing to it reverence for   the small number it ha again and again made a sort of chamber   music of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewhere   in EuropeThe SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to   a superiority over Europe is their ancient manysided MORALISTIC   culture owing to which one find on an average even in the petty   ROMANCIERS of the newspaper and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS a   psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example one   ha no conception to say nothing of the thing itself in Germany   The Germans lack a couple of century of the moralistic work requisite   thereto which a we have said France ha not grudged those who call   the Germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect   As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE   PSYCHOLOGICA which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness   of German intercourseand a the most successful expression of   genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate   thrill Henri Beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and   forerunning man who with a Napoleonic TEMPO traversed HIS Europe   in fact several century of the European soul a a surveyor and   discoverer thereofit ha required two generation to OVERTAKE him   one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddle   that perplexed and enraptured himthis strange Epicurean and man of   interrogation the last great psychologist of FranceThere is yet   a THIRD claim to superiority in the French character there is a   successful halfway synthesis of the North and South which make them   comprehend many thing and enjoins upon them other thing which an   Englishman can never comprehend Their temperament turned alternately   to and from the South in which from time to time the Provencal and   Ligurian blood froth over preserve them from the dreadful northern   greyingrey from sunless conceptualspectrism and from poverty of   bloodour GERMAN infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalence   of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high   politics ha with great resolution been prescribed according to   a dangerous healing art which bid me wait and wait but not yet   hopeThere is also still in France a preunderstanding and   ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are too   comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and   know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the   Souththe born Midlanders the good Europeans For them BIZET   ha made music this latest genius who ha seen a new beauty and   seductionwho ha discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC     255 I hold that many precaution should be taken against German music   Suppose a person love the South a I love itas a great school   of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ill a a   boundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereign   existence believing in itselfwell such a person will learn to be   somewhat on his guard against German music because in injuring his   taste anew it will also injure his health anew Such a Southerner a   Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF if he should dream of the future   of music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the   North and must have in his ear the prelude to a deeper mightier and   perhaps more perverse and mysterious music a superGerman music which   doe not fade pale and die away a all German music doe at the   sight of the blue wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of skya   superEuropean music which hold it own even in presence of the brown   sunset of the desert whose soul is akin to the palmtree and can be   at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beast of prey I   could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew   nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some   sailor homesickness some golden shadow and tender weakness might   sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see   the colour of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing   towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to   receive such belated fugitive     256 Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationalitycraze ha   induced and still induces among the nation of Europe owing also to the   shortsighted and hastyhanded politician who with the help of this   craze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent the   disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude   policyowing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable   at present the most unmistakable sign that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE   are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted With all   the more profound and largeminded men of this century the real general   tendency of the mysterious labour of their soul wa to prepare the way   for that new SYNTHESIS and tentatively to anticipate the European of   the future only in their simulation or in their weaker moment in   old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlandsthey only rested   from themselves when they became patriot I think of such men a   Napoleon Goethe Beethoven Stendhal Heinrich Heine Schopenhauer it   must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them about   whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstanding   genius like him have seldom the right to understand themselves   still le of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now   resisted and opposed in France the fact remains nevertheless that   Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forty are   most closely and intimately related to one another They are akin   fundamentally akin in all the height and depth of their requirement   it is Europe the ONE Europe whose soul press urgently and longingly   outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous artwhither   into a new light towards a new sun But who would attempt to express   accurately what all these master of new mode of speech could not   express distinctly It is certain that the same storm and stress   tormented them that they SOUGHT in the same manner these last great   seeker All of

Let the German friend of Richard Wagner advise together a to   whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art or whether   it distinction doe not consist precisely in coming from SUPERGERMAN   source and impulse in which connection it may not be underrated   how indispensable Paris wa to the development of his type which the   strength of his instinct made him long to visit at the most   decisive timeand how the whole style of his proceeding of his   selfapostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the French   socialistic original On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be   found to the honour of Richard Wagners German nature that he ha   acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation   than a nineteenthcentury Frenchman could have doneowing to the   circumstance that we Germans are a yet nearer to barbarism than the   Frenchperhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is   not only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible and   inimitable to the whole latterday Latin race the figure of Siegfried   that VERY FREE man who is probably far too free too hard too   cheerful too healthy too ANTICATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow   civilized nation He may even have been a sin against Romanticism this   antiLatin Siegfried well Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old   sad day

what ye hear is ROMEROMES FAITH BY INTUITION         CHAPTER IX WHAT IS NOBLE       257 EVERY elevation of the type man ha hitherto been the work of an   aristocratic society and so it will always bea society believing in   a long scale of gradation of rank and difference of worth among human   being and requiring slavery in some form or other Without the PATHOS   OF DISTANCE such a grows out of the incarnated difference of class   out of the constant outlooking and downlooking of the ruling caste on   subordinate and instrument and out of their equally constant   practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a   distancethat other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the   longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself   the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more   comprehensive state in short just the elevation of the type man   the continued selfsurmounting of man to use a moral formula in   a supermoral sense To be sure one must not resign oneself to   any humanitarian illusion about the history of the origin of an   aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition for   the elevation of the type man the truth is hard Let u acknowledge   unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto ha ORIGINATED   Men with a still natural nature barbarian in every terrible sense of   the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will   and desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more   peaceful race perhaps trading or cattlerearing community or upon   old mellow civilization in which the final vital force wa flickering   out in brilliant firework of wit and depravity At the commencement   the noble caste wa always the barbarian caste their superiority did   not consist first of all in their physical but in their psychical   powerthey were more COMPLETE men which at every point also implies   the same a more complete beast     258 Corruptionas the indication that anarchy threatens to break out   among the instinct and that the foundation of the emotion called   life is convulsedis something radically different according to   the organization in which it manifest itself When for instance an   aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution   flung away it privilege with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself   to an excess of it moral sentiment it wa corruptionit wa really   only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for century   by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step it   lordly prerogative and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty in   the end even to it decoration and paradedress The essential thing   however in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard   itself a a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but   a the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereofthat it should   therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion   of individual who FOR ITS SAKE must be suppressed and reduced to   imperfect men to slave and instrument Its fundamental belief must   be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for it own sake but   only a a foundation and scaffolding by mean of which a select class   of being may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duty and   in general to a higher EXISTENCE like those sunseeking climbing plant   in Javathey are called Sipo Matadorwhich encircle an oak so   long and so often with their arm until at last high above it but   supported by it they can unfold their top in the open light and   exhibit their happiness     259 To refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitation   and put one will on a par with that of others this may result in a   certain rough sense in good conduct among individual when the necessary   condition are given namely the actual similarity of the individual   in amount of force and degree of worth and their corelation within one   organization As soon however a one wished to take this principle   more generally and if possible even a the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF   SOCIETY it would immediately disclose what it really isnamely a Will   to the DENIAL of life a principle of dissolution and decay Here one   must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental   weakness life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation injury conquest   of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of   peculiar form incorporation and at the least putting it mildest   exploitationbut why should one for ever use precisely these word   on which for age a disparaging purpose ha been stamped Even the   organization within which a wa previously supposed the   individual treat each other a equalit take place in every   healthy aristocracymust itself if it be a living and not a dying   organization do all that towards other body which the individual   within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the   incarnated Will to Power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground   attract to itself and acquire ascendancynot owing to any morality or   immorality but because it LIVES and because life IS precisely Will to   Power On no point however is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans   more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave   everywhere even under the guise of science about coming condition of   society in which the exploiting character is to be absentthat sound   to my ear a if they promised to invent a mode of life which should   refrain from all organic function Exploitation doe not belong to a   depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of   the living being a a primary organic function it is a consequence   of the intrinsic Will to Power which is precisely the Will to   LifeGranting that a a theory this is a noveltyas a reality it is   the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let u be so far honest towards   ourselves     260 In a tour through the many finer and coarser morality which have   hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth I found certain trait   recurring regularly together and connected with one another until   finally two primary type revealed themselves to me and a radical   distinction wa brought to light There is MASTERMORALITY and   SLAVEMORALITYI would at once add however that in all higher and   mixed civilization there are also attempt at the reconciliation of   the two morality but one find still oftener the confusion and   mutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their close   juxtapositioneven in the same man within one soul The distinction   of moral value have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly   conscious of being different from the ruledor among the ruled class   the slave and dependent of all sort In the first case when it is   the ruler who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud   disposition which is regarded a the distinguishing feature and that   which determines the order of rank The noble type of man separate   from himself the being in whom the opposite of this exalted proud   disposition display itself he despises them Let it at once be noted   that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad   mean practically the same a noble and despicablethe antithesis   good and EVIL is of a different origin The cowardly the timid the   insignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised   moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glance the   selfabasing the doglike kind of men who let themselves be abused   the mendicant flatterer and above all the liarsit is a fundamental   belief of all aristocrat that the common people are untruthful We   truthful onesthe nobility in ancient Greece called themselves It is   obvious that everywhere the designation of moral value were at first   applied to MEN and were only derivatively and at a later period applied   to ACTIONS it is a gross mistake therefore when historian of moral   start with question like Why have sympathetic action been praised   The noble type of man regard HIMSELF a a determiner of value he   doe not require to be approved of he pass the judgment What is   injurious to me is injurious in itself he know that it is he himself   only who confers honour on thing he is a CREATOR OF VALUES He   honour whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equal   selfglorification In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude   of power which seek to overflow the happiness of high tension the   consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestowthe noble   man also help the unfortunate but notor scarcelyout of pity but   rather from an impulse generated by the superabundance of power The   noble man honour in himself the powerful one him also who ha power   over himself who know how to speak and how to keep silence who   take pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and ha   reverence for all that is severe and hard Wotan placed a hard heart in   my breast say an old Scandinavian Saga it is thus rightly expressed   from the soul of a proud Viking Such a type of man is even proud of not   being made for sympathy the hero of the Saga therefore add warningly   He who ha not a hard heart when young will never have one The noble   and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality   which see precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of others   or in DESINTERESSEMENT the characteristic of the moral faith   in oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towards   selflessness belong a definitely to noble morality a do a careless   scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heartIt   is the powerful who KNOW how to honour it is their art their domain   for invention The profound reverence for age and for traditionall law   rest on this double reverencethe belief and prejudice in favour of   ancestor and unfavourable to newcomer is typical in the morality of   the powerful and if reversely men of modern idea believe almost   instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more   lacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these idea ha   complacently betrayed itself thereby A morality of the ruling class   however is more especially foreign and irritating to presentday taste   in the sternness of it principle that one ha duty only to one   equal that one may act towards being of a lower rank towards all   that is foreign just a seems good to one or a the heart desire   and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and   similar sentiment can have a place The ability and obligation to   exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revengeboth only within the   circle of equalsartfulness in retaliation RAFFINEMENT of the idea   in friendship a certain necessity to have enemy a outlet for the   emotion of envy quarrelsomeness arrogancein fact in order to be   a good FRIEND all these are typical characteristic of the noble   morality which a ha been pointed out is not the morality of modern   idea and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also to   unearth and discloseIt is otherwise with the second type of morality   SLAVEMORALITY Supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering   the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should   moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimate   Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of   man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with   his situation The slave ha an unfavourable eye for the virtue of the   powerful he ha a skepticism and distrust a REFINEMENT of distrust of   everything good that is there honouredhe would fain persuade himself   that the very happiness there is not genuine On the other hand THOSE   quality which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferer are   brought into prominence and flooded with light it is here that   sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence   humility and friendliness attain to honour for here these are the most   useful quality and almost the only mean of supporting the burden of   existence Slavemorality is essentially the morality of utility   Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and   evilpower and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil   a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of   being despised According to slavemorality therefore the evil man   arouses fear according to mastermorality it is precisely the good   man who arouses fear and seek to arouse it while the bad man is   regarded a the despicable being The contrast attains it maximum when   in accordance with the logical consequence of slavemorality a shade   of depreciationit may be slight and wellintentionedat last attache   itself to the good man of this morality because according to the   servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the SAFE   man he is goodnatured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid un   bonhomme Everywhere that slavemorality gain the ascendancy language   show a tendency to approximate the signification of the word good   and stupidA last fundamental difference the desire for FREEDOM   the instinct for happiness and the refinement of the feeling of liberty   belong a necessarily to slavemorals and morality a artifice and   enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptom of an   aristocratic mode of thinking and estimatingHence we can understand   without further detail why love AS A PASSIONit is our European   specialtymust absolutely be of noble origin a is well known it   invention is due to the Provencal poetcavaliers those brilliant   ingenious men of the gai saber to whom Europe owes so much and   almost owes itself     261 Vanity is one of the thing which are perhaps most difficult for   a noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where another   kind of man think he see it selfevidently The problem for him is   to represent to his mind being who seek to arouse a good opinion of   themselves which they themselves do not possessand consequently also   do not deserveand who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion   afterwards This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so   selfdisrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable   that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful   about it in most case when it is spoken of He will say for   instance I may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand   may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others   precisely a I rate itthat however is not vanity but selfconceit   or in most case that which is called humility and also   modesty Or he will even say For many reason I can delight in   the good opinion of others perhaps because I love and honour them   and rejoice in all their joy perhaps also because their good opinion   endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps   because the good opinion of others even in case where I do not share   it is useful to me or give promise of usefulnessall this however   is not vanity The man of noble character must first bring it home   forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from   time immemorial in all social stratum in any way dependent the ordinary   man WAS only that which he PASSED FORnot being at all accustomed to   fix value he did not assign even to himself any other value than that   which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to   create value It may be looked upon a the result of an extraordinary   atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always WAITING   for an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself   to it yet by no mean only to a good opinion but also to a bad   and unjust one think for instance of the greater part of the   selfappreciations and selfdepreciations which believing woman learn   from their confessor and which in general the believing Christian   learns from his Church In fact conformably to the slow rise of the   democratic social order and it cause the blending of the blood   of master and slave the originally noble and rare impulse of   the master to assign a value to themselves and to think well of   themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but   it ha at all time an older ampler and more radically ingrained   propensity opposed to itand in the phenomenon of vanity this older   propensity overmasters the younger The vain person rejoices over EVERY   good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point   of view of it usefulness and equally regardless of it truth or   falsehood just a he suffers from every bad opinion for he subject   himself to both he feel himself subjected to both by that oldest   instinct of subjection which break forth in himIt is the slave   in the vain man blood the remains of the slave craftinessand how   much of the slave is still left in woman for instancewhich   seek to SEDUCE to good opinion of itself it is the slave too who   immediately afterwards fall prostrate himself before these opinion a   though he had not called them forthAnd to repeat it again vanity is   an atavism     262 A SPECIES originates and a type becomes established and strong in   the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE condition On   the other hand it is known by the experience of breeder that specie   which receive superabundant nourishment and in general a surplus of   protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop   variation and are fertile in prodigy and monstrosity also in   monstrous vice Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say   an ancient Greek polis or Venice a a voluntary or involuntary   contrivance for the purpose of REARING human being there are there men   beside one another thrown upon their own resource who want to make   their specie prevail chiefly because they MUST prevail or else   run the terrible danger of being exterminated The favour the   superabundance the protection are there lacking under which variation   are fostered the specie need itself a specie a something which   precisely by virtue of it hardness it uniformity and simplicity of   structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in   constant struggle with it neighbour or with rebellious or   rebellionthreatening vassal The most varied experience teach it   what are the quality to which it principally owes the fact that   it still exists in spite of all Gods and men and ha hitherto been   victorious these quality it call virtue and these virtue alone   it develops to maturity It doe so with severity indeed it desire   severity every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education   of youth in the control of woman in the marriage custom in the   relation of old and young in the penal law which have an eye only   for the degenerating it count intolerance itself among the virtue   under the name of justice A type with few but very marked feature   a specie of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent   men and a such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and   nuance of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitude   of generation the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE   condition is a already remarked the cause of a type becoming   stable and hard Finally however a happy state of thing result the   enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps no more enemy among the   neighbouring people and the mean of life even of the enjoyment   of life are present in superabundance With one stroke the bond and   constraint of the old discipline severs it is no longer regarded a   necessary a a condition of existenceif it would continue it can   only do so a a form of LUXURY a an archaizing TASTE Variations   whether they be deviation into the higher finer and rarer or   deterioration and monstrosity appear suddenly on the scene in the   greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dare to be individual   and detach himself At this turningpoint of history there manifest   themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a   magnificent manifold virginforestlike upgrowth and upstriving a   kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary   decay and selfdestruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly   exploding egoism which strive with one another for sun and light   and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for   themselves by mean of the hitherto existing morality It wa this   morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bent   the bow in so threatening a mannerit is now out of date it is   getting out of date The dangerous and disquieting point ha been   reached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life IS   LIVED BEYOND the old morality the individual stand out and is   obliged to have recourse to his own lawgiving his own art and   artifice for selfpreservation selfelevation and selfdeliverance   Nothing but new Why s nothing but new How s no common formula any   longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay   deterioration and the loftiest desire frightfully entangled the   genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopia of good and bad   a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn full of new charm   and mystery peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied   corruption Danger is again present the mother of morality great   danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and   friend into the street into their own child into their own heart   into all the most personal and secret recess of their desire and   volition What will the moral philosopher who appear at this time have   to preach They discover these sharp onlooker and loafer that the   end is quickly approaching that everything around them decay and   produce decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow   except one specie of man the incurably MEDIOCRE The mediocre alone   have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselvesthey will   be the men of the future the sole survivor be like them become   mediocre is now the only morality which ha still a significance   which still obtains a hearingBut it is difficult to preach this   morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it   desire it ha to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly   loveit will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY     263 There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK which more than anything else is   already the sign of a HIGH rank there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES   of reverence which lead one to infer noble origin and habit The   refinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test   when something pass by that is of the highest rank but is not   yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touch and   incivility something that go it way like a living touchstone   undistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiled   and disguised He whose task and practice it is to investigate soul   will avail himself of many variety of this very art to determine the   ultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to which   it belongs he will test it by it INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE DIFFERENCE   ENGENDRE HAINE the vulgarity of many a nature spurt up suddenly like   dirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrine any   book bearing the mark of great destiny is brought before it while   on the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of the   eye a cessation of all gesture by which it is indicated that a soul   FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect The way in which on   the whole the reverence for the BIBLE ha hitherto been maintained   in Europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of   manner which Europe owes to Christianity book of such profoundness   and supreme significance require for their protection an external   tyranny of authority in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousand of   year which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them Much ha been   achieved when the sentiment ha been at last instilled into the mass   the shallowpates and the booby of every kind that they are not   allowed to touch everything that there are holy experience before   which they must take off their shoe and keep away the unclean handit   is almost their highest advance towards humanity On the contrary in   the socalled cultured class the believer in modern idea nothing   is perhaps so repulsive a their lack of shame the easy insolence of   eye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything and it   is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste and   more tact for reverence among the people among the lower class of   the people especially among peasant than among the newspaperreading   DEMIMONDE

desk and a cashbox modest and citizenlike   in their desire modest also in their virtue or whether they were   accustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasure   and probably of still ruder duty and responsibility or whether   finally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privilege of   birth and possession in order to live wholly for their faithfor their   Godas men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blush   at every compromise It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have   the quality and predilection of his parent and ancestor in his   constitution whatever appearance may suggest to the contrary This is   the problem of race Granted that one know something of the parent   it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child any kind   of offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsy   selfvauntingthe three thing which together have constituted the   genuine plebeian type in all timessuch must pas over to the child a   surely a bad blood and with the help of the best education and culture   one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredityAnd   what else doe education and culture try to do nowadays In our very   democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture MUST   be essentially the art of deceivingdeceiving with regard to origin   with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul An educator   who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called out   constantly to his pupil Be true Be natural Show yourselves a you   areeven such a virtuous and

of displeasing innocent ear I submit that egoism   belongs to the essence of a noble soul I mean the unalterable belief   that to a being such a we other being must naturally be in   subjection and have to sacrifice themselves The noble soul accepts the   fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of   harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather a something   that may have it basis in the primary law of thingsif he sought a   designation for it he would say It is justice itself He acknowledges   under certain circumstance which made him hesitate at first that   there are other equally privileged one a soon a he ha settled this   question of rank he move among those equal and equally privileged   one with the same assurance a regard modesty and delicate respect   which he enjoys in intercourse with himselfin accordance with an   innate heavenly mechanism which all the star understand It is an   ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism this artfulness and selflimitation   in intercourse with his equalsevery star is a similar egoist he   honour HIMSELF in them and in the right which he concedes to them he   ha no doubt that the exchange of honour and right a the ESSENCE of   all intercourse belongs also to the natural condition of thing The   noble soul give a he take prompted by the passionate and sensitive   instinct of requital which is at the root of his nature The notion of   favour ha INTER PARES neither significance nor good repute there   may be a sublime way of letting gift a it were light upon one from   above and of drinking them thirstily like dewdrop but for those   art and display the noble soul ha no aptitude His egoism hinders him   here in general he look aloft unwillinglyhe look either FORWARD   horizontally and deliberately or downwardsHE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A   HEIGHT     266 One can only truly esteem him who doe not LOOK OUT FOR   himselfGoethe to Rath Schlosser     267 The Chinese have a proverb which mother even teach their child   SIAOSIN MAKE THY HEART SMALL This is the essentially fundamental   tendency in latterday civilization I have no doubt that an ancient   Greek also would first of all remark the selfdwarfing in u Europeans   of todayin this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful   to him     268 What after all is ignoblenessWords are vocal symbol for   idea idea however are more or le definite mental symbol   for frequently returning and concurring sensation for group of   sensation It is not sufficient to use the same word in order to   understand one another we must also employ the same word for the same   kind of internal experience we must in the end have experience IN   COMMON On this account the people of one nation understand one another

rarely about   these matter people understand one another rapidly and always more   rapidlythe history of language is the history of a process of   abbreviation on the basis of this quick comprehension people always   unite closer and closer The greater the danger the greater is the   need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to   misunderstand one another in dangerthat is what can not at all be   dispensed with in intercourse Also in all love and friendship one ha   the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery   ha been made that in using the same word one of the two party ha   feeling thought intuition wish or fear different from those of   the other The fear of the eternal misunderstanding that is the good   genius which so often keep person of different sex from too   hasty attachment to which sense and heart prompt themand NOT some   Schopenhauerian genius of the specie Whichever group of sensation   within a soul

more a psychologista born an unavoidable psychologist   and souldivinerturns his attention to the more select case and   individual the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy   he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man For   the corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusually   constituted soul is in fact the rule it is dreadful to have such a   rule always before one eye The manifold torment of the psychologist   who ha discovered this ruination who discovers once and then   discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history this universal   inner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late in every   sensemay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with   bitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt at   selfdestructionof his going to ruin himself One may perceive   in almost every psychologist a telltale inclination for delightful   intercourse with commonplace and wellordered men the fact is thereby   disclosed that he always requires healing that he need a sort   of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight and   incisivenessfrom what his businesshas laid upon his conscience   The fear of his memory is peculiar to him He is easily silenced by the   judgment of others he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour   admire love and glorify where he ha PERCEIVEDor he even conceals   his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion Perhaps   the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that precisely   where he ha learnt GREAT SYMPATHY together with great CONTEMPT the   multitude the educated and the visionary have on their part learnt   great reverencereverence for great men and marvelous animal for   the sake of whom one blesses and honour the fatherland the earth the   dignity of mankind and one own self to whom one point the young   and in view of whom one educates them And who know but in all great   instance hitherto just the same happened that the multitude worshipped   a God and that the God wa only a poor sacrificial animal SUCCESS   ha always been the greatest liarand the work itself is a success   the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised in   their creation until they are unrecognizable the work of the artist   of the philosopher only invents him who ha created it is REPUTED   to have created it

Leopardi Kleist Gogol I do not venture to mention   much greater name but I have them in my mind a they now appear and   were perhaps obliged to be men of the moment enthusiastic sensuous   and childish lightminded and impulsive in their trust and distrust   with soul in which usually some flaw ha to be concealed often taking   revenge with their work for an internal defilement often seeking   forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost in   the mud and almost in love with it until they become like the   WillotheWisps around the swamp and PRETEND TO BE starsthe people

blundering even the best and deepest love   ishe find that it rather DESTROYS than savesIt is possible that   under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden   one of the most painful case of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE   the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart that   never had enough of any human love that DEMANDED love that demanded   inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terrible   outburst against those who refused him their love the story of a poor   soul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to send   thither those who WOULD NOT love himand that at last enlightened   about human love had to invent a God who is entire love entire   CAPACITY for lovewho take pity on human love

that it   is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask   and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place     271 That which separate two men most profoundly is a different sense   and grade of purity What doe it matter about all their honesty and   reciprocal usefulness what doe it matter about all their mutual   goodwill the fact still remainsthey can not smell each other The   highest instinct for purity place him who is affected with it in the   most extraordinary and dangerous isolation a a saint for it is just   holinessthe highest spiritualization of the instinct in question Any   kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath   any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out   of night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction into   clearness brightness depth and refinementjust a much a such a   tendency DISTINGUISHESit is a noble tendencyit also SEPARATESThe   pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human alltoohuman   And there are grade and height where pity itself is regarded by him a   impurity a filth     272 Signs of nobility never to think of lowering our duty to the   rank of duty for everybody to be unwilling to renounce or to share   our responsibility to count our prerogative and the exercise of   them among our DUTIES     273 A man who strives after great thing look upon every one whom   he encounter on his way either a a mean of advance or a delay and   hindranceor a a temporary restingplace His peculiar lofty BOUNTY   to his fellowmen is only possible when he attains his elevation and   dominates Impatience and the consciousness of being always condemned   to comedy up to that timefor even strife is a comedy and conceals the   end a every mean doesspoil all intercourse for him this kind of   man is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it     274 THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAITHappy chance are necessary and   many

 and in all corner of the earth there are waiting one sitting who   hardly know to what extent they are waiting and still le that they   wait in vain Occasionally too the waking call come too latethe   chance which give permission to take actionwhen their best youth   and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many   a one just a he sprang up ha found with horror that his limb are   benumbed and his spirit are now too heavy It is too late he ha   said to himselfand ha become selfdistrustful and henceforth for ever   uselessIn the domain of genius may not the Raphael without   hand taking the expression in it widest sense perhaps not be the   exception but the rulePerhaps genius is by no mean so rare but   rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize   over the GREEK INSERTED HERE the right timein order to take   chance by the forelock     275 He who doe not WISH to see the height of a man look all the   more sharply at what is low in him and in the foregroundand thereby   betrays himself     276 In all kind of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is   better off than the nobler soul the danger of the latter must be   greater the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in   fact immense considering the multiplicity of the condition of it   existenceIn a lizard a finger grows again which ha been lost not so   in man     277 It is too bad Always the old story When a man ha finished   building his house he find that he ha learnt unawares something   which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before hebegan to build The   eternal fatal Too late The melancholia of everything COMPLETED     278Wanderer who art thou I see thee follow thy path without scorn   without love with unfathomable eye wet and sad a a

profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy they   have a mode of seizing upon happiness a though they would choke and   strangle it out of jealousyah they know only too well that it will   flee from them     280 Bad Bad What Does he notgo back Yes But you misunderstand   him when you complain about it He go back like every one who is about   to make a great spring     281Will people believe it of me But I insist that they believe it   of me I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about   myself only in very rare case only compulsorily always without   delight in the subject ready to digress from myself and always   without faith in the result owing to an unconquerable distrust of the   POSSIBILITY of selfknowledge which ha led me so far a to feel a   CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of direct knowledge which   theorist allow themselvesthis matter of fact is almost the most   certain thing I know about myself There must be a sort of repugnance   in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myselfIs there perhaps   some enigma therein Probably but fortunately nothing for my own   teethPerhaps it betrays the specie to which I belongbut not to   myself a is sufficiently agreeable to me     282But what ha happened to youI do not know he said   hesitatingly perhaps the Harpies have flown over my tableIt   sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle sober retiring man becomes   suddenly mad break the plate upset the table shriek raf   and shock everybodyand finally withdraws ashamed and raging at   himselfwhither for what purpose To famish apart To suffocate with   his memoriesTo him who ha the desire of a lofty and dainty soul   and only seldom find his table laid and his food prepared the danger   will always be greatnowadays however it is extraordinarily so   Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age with which he doe   not like to eat out of the same dish he may readily perish of hunger   and thirstor should he nevertheless finally fall to of sudden   nauseaWe have probably all sat at table to which we did not belong   and precisely the most spiritual of u who are most difficult to   nourish know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden   insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmatesthe   AFTERDINNER NAUSEA     283 If one wish to praise at all it is a delicate and at the   same time a noble selfcontrol to praise only where one DOES NOT   agreeotherwise in fact one would praise oneself which is contrary   to good tastea selfcontrol to be sure which offer excellent   opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING To be able to   allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one must   not live among intellectual imbecile but rather among men whose   misunderstanding and mistake amuse by their refinementor one will   have to pay dearly for itHe praise me THEREFORE he acknowledges me   to be rightthis asinine method of inference spoil half of the life   of u recluse for it brings the ass into our neighbourhood and   friendship     284 To live in a vast and proud tranquility always beyond To have   or not to have one emotion one For and Against according to   choice to lower oneself to them for hour to SEAT oneself on them a   upon horse and often a upon assesfor one must know how to make   use of their stupidity a well a of their

Goethes   Faust Part II Act V The word of Dr MarianusBut there is a   reverse kind of man who is also upon a height and ha also a free   prospectbut look DOWNWARDS     287 What is noble What doe the word noble still mean for u   nowadays How doe the noble man betray himself how is he recognized   under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by which   everything is rendered opaque and leadenIt is not his action which   establish his claimactions are always ambiguous always inscrutable   neither is it his work One find nowadays among artist and scholar   plenty of those who betray by their work that a profound longing for   nobleness impels them but this very NEED of nobleness is radically   different from the need of the noble soul itself and is in fact the   eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof It is not the work   but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of   rankto employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper   meaningit is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul ha about   itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and   perhaps also is not to be lostTHE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR   ITSELF     288 There are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn   and twist themselves a they will and hold their hand before their   treacherous eyesas though the hand were not a betrayer it always   come out at last that they have something which they hidenamely   intellect One of the subtlest mean of deceiving at least a long a   possible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider   than one really iswhich in everyday life is often a desirable a   an umbrellais called ENTHUSIASM including what belongs to it for   instance virtue For a Galiani said who wa obliged to know it VERTU   EST ENTHOUSIASME     289 In the writing of a recluse one always hears something of the echo   of the wilderness something of the murmuring tone and timid vigilance   of solitude in his strongest word even in his cry itself there   sound a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment He who   ha sat day and night from year end to year end alone with his   soul in familiar discord and discourse he who ha become a cavebear   or a treasureseeker or a treasureguardian and dragon in his caveit   may be a labyrinth but can also be a goldminehis idea themselves   eventually acquire a twilightcolour of their own and an odour a much   of the depth a of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive   which blow chilly upon every passerby The recluse doe not believe   that a philosophersupposing that a philosopher ha always in the first   place been a recluseever expressed his actual and ultimate opinion in   book are not book written precisely to hide what is in usindeed   he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have ultimate and actual   opinion at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must   necessarily be a still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer   world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every   foundation Every philosophy is a foreground philosophythis is a   recluse verdict There is something arbitrary in the fact that the   PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around   that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeperthere   is also something suspicious in it Every philosophy also CONCEALS a   philosophy every opinion is also a LURKINGPLACE every word is also a   MASK     290 Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being   misunderstood The latter perhaps wound his vanity but the former   wound his heart his sympathy which always say Ah why would you   also have a hard a time of it a I have     291 Man a COMPLEX mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny   to the other animal by his artifice and sagacity rather than by his   strength ha invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his   soul a something SIMPLE and the whole of morality is a long audacious   falsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of   the soul becomes possible From this point of view there is perhaps much   more in the conception of art than is generally believed     292 A philosopher that is a man who constantly experience see   hears suspect hope and dream extraordinary thing who is struck   by his own thought a if they came from the outside from above and   below a a specie of event and lightningflashes PECULIAR TO HIM who   is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightning a portentous   man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and   something uncanny going on A philosopher ala a being who often   run away from himself is often afraid of himselfbut whose curiosity   always make him come to himself again     293 A man who say I like that I take it for my own and mean to   guard and protect it from every one a man who can conduct a case   carry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a woman   punish and overthrow insolence a man who ha his indignation and his   sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the   animal willingly submit and naturally belong in short a man who is a   MASTER by naturewhen such a man ha sympathy well THAT sympathy ha   value But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer Or of   those even who preach sympathy There is nowadays throughout almost the   whole of Europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain   and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing   which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seek   to deck itself out a something superiorthere is a regular cult of   suffering The UNMANLINESS of that which is called sympathy by such   group of visionary is always I believe the first thing that   strike the eyeOne must resolutely and radically taboo this latest   form of bad taste and finally I wish people to put the good amulet   GAI SABER gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck a   a protection against it     294 THE OLYMPIAN VICEDespite the philosopher who a a genuine   Englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking   mindsLaughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which every   thinking mind will strive to overcome HobbesI would even   allow myself to rank philosopher according to the quality of their   laughingup to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter And supposing   that Gods also philosophize which I am strongly inclined to believe   owing to many reasonsI have no doubt that they also know how to laugh   thereby in an overmanlike and new fashionand at the expense of all   serious thing Gods are fond of ridicule it seems that they can not   refrain from laughter even in holy matter     295 The genius of the heart a that great mysterious one posse   it the temptergod and born ratcatcher of conscience whose voice can   descend into the netherworld of every soul who neither speaks a word   nor cast a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch   of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he know how to   appearnot a he is but in a guise which act a an ADDITIONAL   constraint on his follower to press ever closer to him to follow him   more cordially and thoroughlythe genius of the heart which imposes   silence and attention on everything loud and selfconceited which   smoothes rough soul and make them taste a new longingto lie placid   a a mirror that the deep heaven may be reflected in themthe genius   of the heart which teach the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate   and to grasp more delicately which scent the hidden and forgotten   treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark   ice and is a diviningrod for every grain of gold long buried and   imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with   which every one go away richer not favoured or surprised not a   though gratified and oppressed by the good thing of others but richer   in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a   thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more   bruised but full of hope which a yet lack name full of a new will   and current full of a new illwill and countercurrent but what am I   doing my friend Of whom am I talking to you Have I forgotten myself   so far that I have not even told you his name Unless it be that you   have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God   and spirit is that wish to be PRAISED in such a manner For a it   happens to every one who from childhood onward ha always been on his   leg and in foreign land I have also encountered on my path many   strange and dangerous spirit above all however and again and again   the one of whom I have just spoken in fact no le a personage than   the God DIONYSUS the great equivocator and tempter to whom a you   know I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my firstfruitsthe   last a it seems to me who ha offered a SACRIFICE to him for I   have found no one who could understand what I wa then doing In   the meantime however I have learned much far too much about the   philosophy of this God and a I said from mouth to mouthI the last   disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus and perhaps I might at last   begin to give you my friend a far a I am allowed a little taste of   this philosophy In a hushed voice a is but seemly for it ha to do   with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny The   very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore Gods also   philosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and might   perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophersamong you my   friend there is le to be said against it except that it come too   late and not at the right time for a it ha been disclosed to me you   are loth nowadays to believe in God and god It may happen too that   in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the   strict usage of your ear Certainly the God in question went further   very much further in such dialogue and wa always many pace ahead of   me Indeed if it were allowed I should have to give him according   to human usage fine ceremonious tide of lustre and merit I should   have to extol his courage a investigator and discoverer his fearless   honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom But such a God doe not know   what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp Keep that he   would say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else require   it Ihave no reason to cover my nakedness One suspect that this   kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lack shameHe once said   Under certain circumstance I love mankindand referred thereby to   Ariadne who wa present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave   inventive animal that ha not his equal upon earth he make his way   even through all labyrinth I like man and often think how I can   still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more   profoundStronger more evil and more profound I asked in horror   Yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more   beautifuland thereby the temptergod smiled with his halcyon smile   a though he had just paid some charming compliment One here see at   once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacksand in general   there are good ground for supposing that in some thing the Gods could   all of them come to u men for instruction We men aremore human     296 Alas what are you after all my written and painted thought Not   long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorn   and secret spice that you made me sneeze and laughand now You   have already doffed your novelty and some of you I fear are ready   to become truth so immortal do they look so pathetically honest so   tedious And wa it ever otherwise What then do we write and paint   we mandarin with Chinese brush we immortalisers of thing which LEND   themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting Alas only   that which is just about to fade and begin to lose it odour Alas   only exhausted and departing storm and belated yellow sentiment Alas   only bird strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves be   captured with the handwith OUR hand We immortalize what can not live   and fly much longer thing only which are exhausted and mellow And it   is only for your AFTERNOON you my written and painted thought for   which alone I have colour many colour perhaps many variegated   softening and fifty yellow and brown and green and redsbut   nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning you sudden   spark and

and interlude chapter v the natural history of moral chapter vi we scholar chapter vii our virtue chapter viii people and country chapter ix what is noble from the height poem translated by la magnus preface supposing that truth is a womanwhat then is there not ground for suspecting that all philosopher in so far a they have been dogmatist have failed to understand womenthat the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their address to truth have been unskilled and unseemly method for winning a woman certainly she ha never allowed herself to be won and at present every kind of dogma stand with sad and discouraged mienif indeed it stand at all for there are scoffer who maintain that it ha fallen that all dogma lie on the groundnay more that it is at it last gasp but to speak seriously there are good ground for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive and decided air it ha assumed may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood what ha actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifice a the dogmatist have hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time such a the soulsuperstition which in the form of subject and egosuperstition ha not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some play upon word a deception on the part of grammar or an audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very humanalltoohuman fact the philosophy of the dogmatist it is to be hoped wa only a promise for thousand of year afterwards a wa astrology in still earlier time in the service of which probably more labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto we owe to it and to it superterrestrial pretension in asia and egypt the grand style of architecture it seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claim all great thing have first to wander about the earth a enormous and aweinspiring caricature dogmatic philosophy ha been a caricature of this kindfor instance the vedanta doctrine in asia and platonism in europe let u not be ungrateful to it although it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome and the most dangerous of error hitherto ha been a dogmatist errornamely plato invention of pure spirit and the good in itself but now when it ha been surmounted when europe rid of this nightmare can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthiersleep we whose duty is wakefulness itself are the heir of all the strength which the struggle against this error ha fostered it amounted to the very inversion of truth and the denial of the perspectivethe fundamental conditionof life to speak of spirit and the good a plato spoke of them indeed one might ask a a physician how did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity plato had the wicked socrates really corrupted him wa socrates after all a corrupter of youth and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against plato orto speak plainer and for the peoplethe struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millennium of christianity for christianity is platonism for the people produced in europe a magnificent tension of soul such a had not existed anywhere previously with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goal a a matter of fact the european feel this tension a a state of distress and twice attempt have been made in grand style to unbend the bow once by mean of jesuitism and the second time by mean of democratic enlightenmentwhich with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaperreading might in fact bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in distress the german invented gunpowderall credit to them but they again made thing squarethey invented printing but we who are neither jesuit nor democrat nor even sufficiently german we good european and free very free spiritswe have it still all the distress of spirit and all the tension of it bow and perhaps also the arrow the duty and who know the goal to aim at sils maria upper engadine june 1885 chapter i prejudice of philosopher 1 the will to truth which is to tempt u to many a hazardous enterprise the famous truthfulness of which all philosopher have hitherto spoken with respect what question ha this will to truth not laid before u what strange perplexing questionable question it is already a long story yet it seems a if it were hardly commenced is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful lose patience and turn impatiently away that this sphinx teach u at last to ask question ourselves who is it really that put question to u here what really is this will to truth in u in fact we made a long halt at the question a to the origin of this willuntil at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question we inquired about the value of this will granted that we want the truth why not rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of the value of truth presented itself before usor wa it we who presented ourselves before the problem which of u is the oedipus here which the sphinx it would seem to be a rendezvous of question and note of interrogation and could it be believed that it at last seems to u a if the problem had never been propounded before a if we were the first to discern it get a sight of it and risk raising it for there is risk in raising it perhaps there is no greater risk 2 how could anything originate out of it opposite for example truth out of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or the generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sunbright vision of the wise man out of covetousness such genesis is impossible whoever dream of it is a fool nay worse than a fool thing of the highest value must have a different origin an origin of their ownin this transitory seductive illusory paltry world in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity they can not have their source but rather in the lap of being in the intransitory in the concealed god in the thinginitselfthere must be their source and nowhere elsethis mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all time can be recognized this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure through this belief of theirs they exert themselves for their knowledge for something that is in the end solemnly christened the truth the fundamental belief of metaphysicians is the belief in antithesis of value it never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold where doubt however wa most necessary though they had made a solemn vow de omnibus dubitandum for it may be doubted firstly whether antithesis exist at all and secondly whether the popular valuation and antithesis of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal are not perhaps merely superficial estimate merely provisional perspective besides being probably made from some corner perhaps from belowfrog perspective a it were to borrow an expression current among painter in spite of all the value which may belong to the true the positive and the unselfish it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence to the will to delusion to selfishness and cupidity it might even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good and respected thing consists precisely in their being insidiously related knotted and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed thingsperhaps even in being essentially identical with them perhaps but who wish to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses for that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosopher such a will have other taste and inclination the reverse of those hitherto prevalentphilosophers of the dangerous perhaps in every sense of the term and to speak in all seriousness i see such new philosopher beginning to appear 3 having kept a sharp eye on philosopher and having read between their line long enough i now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive function and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking one ha here to learn anew a one learned anew about heredity and innateness a little a the act of birth come into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity just a little is beingconscious opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instinct and forced into definite channel and behind all logic and it seeming sovereignty of movement there are valuation or to speak more plainly physiological demand for the maintenance of a definite mode of life for example that the certain is worth more than the uncertain that illusion is le valuable than truth such valuation in spite of their regulative importance for u might notwithstanding be only superficial valuation special kind of niaiserie such a may be necessary for the maintenance of being such a ourselves supposing in effect that man is not just the measure of thing 4 the falseness of an opinion is not for u any objection to it it is here perhaps that our new language sound most strangely the question is how far an opinion is lifefurthering lifepreserving speciespreserving perhaps speciesrearing and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinion to which the synthetic judgment a priori belong are the most indispensable to u that without a recognition of logical fiction without a comparison of reality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutable without a constant counterfeiting of the world by mean of number man could not livethat the renunciation of false opinion would be a renunciation of life a negation of life to recognise untruth a a condition of life that is certainly to impugn the traditional idea of value in a dangerous manner and a philosophy which venture to do so ha thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil 5 that which cause philosopher to be regarded halfdistrustfully and halfmockingly is not the oftrepeated discovery how innocent they arehow often and easily they make mistake and lose their way in short how childish and childlike they arebut that there is not enough honest dealing with them whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner they all pose a though their real opinion had been discovered and attained through the selfevolving of a cold pure divinely indifferent dialectic in contrast to all sort of mystic who fairer and foolisher talk of inspiration whereas in fact a prejudiced proposition idea or suggestion which is generally their heart desire abstracted and refined is defended by them with argument sought out after the event they are all advocate who do not wish to be regarded a such generally astute defender also of their prejudice which they dub truthsand very far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself very far from having the good taste of the courage which go so far a to let this be understood perhaps to warn friend or foe or in cheerful confidence and selfridicule the spectacle of the tartuffery of old kant equally stiff and decent with which he entices u into the dialectic byway that lead more correctly mislead to his categorical imperativemakes u fastidious one smile we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle trick of old moralist and ethical preacher or still more so the hocuspocus in mathematical form by mean of which spinoza ha a it were clad his philosophy in mail and maskin fact the love of his wisdom to translate the term fairly and squarelyin order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden that pallas athenehow much of personal timidity and vulnerability doe this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray 6 it ha gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now ha consisted ofnamely the confession of it originator and a specie of involuntary and unconscious autobiography and moreover that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy ha constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant ha always grown indeed to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertion of a philosopher have been arrived at it is always well and wise to first ask oneself what morality do they or doe he aim at accordingly i do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy but that another impulse here a elsewhere ha only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge a an instrument but whoever considers the fundamental impulse of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted a inspiring genius or a demon and cobolds will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself a the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord over all the other impulse for every impulse is imperious and a such attempt to philosophize to be sure in the case of scholar in the case of really scientific men it may be otherwisebetter if you will there there may really be such a thing a an impulse to knowledge some kind of small independent clockwork which when well wound up work away industriously to that end without the rest of the scholarly impulse taking any material part therein the actual interest of the scholar therefore are generally in quite another directionin the family perhaps or in moneymaking or in politics it is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist a mushroom specialist or a chemist he is not characterised by becoming this or that in the philosopher on the contrary there is absolutely nothing impersonal and above all his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony a to who he isthat is to say in what order the deepest impulse of his nature stand to each other 7 how malicious philosopher can be i know of nothing more stinging than the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and the platonist he called them dionysiokolakes in it original sense and on the face of it the word signifies flatterer of dionysiusconsequently tyrant accessory and lickspittles besides this however it is a much a to say they are all actor there is nothing genuine about them for dionysiokolax wa a popular name for an actor and the latter is really the malignant reproach that epicurus cast upon plato he wa annoyed by the grandiose manner the mise en scene style of which plato and his scholar were mastersof which epicurus wa not a master he the old schoolteacher of samos who sat concealed in his little garden at athens and wrote three hundred book perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato who know greece took a hundred year to find out who the gardengod epicurus really wa did she ever find out 8 there is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of the philosopher appears on the scene or to put it in the word of an ancient mystery adventavit asinus pulcher et fortissimus 9 you desire to live according to nature oh you noble stoic what fraud of word imagine to yourselves a being like nature boundlessly extravagant boundlessly indifferent without purpose or consideration without pity or justice at once fruitful and barren and uncertain imagine to yourselves indifference a a powerhow could you live in accordance with such indifference to liveis not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this nature is not living valuing preferring being unjust being limited endeavouring to be different and granted that your imperative living according to nature mean actually the same a living according to lifehow could you do differently why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are and must be in reality however it is quite otherwise with you while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in nature you want something quite the contrary you extraordinary stageplayers and selfdeluders in your pride you wish to dictate your moral and ideal to nature to nature herself and to incorporate them therein you insist that it shall be nature according to the stoa and would like everything to be made after your own image a a vast eternal glorification and generalism of stoicism with all your love for truth you have forced yourselves so long so persistently and with such hypnotic rigidity to see nature falsely that is to say stoically that you are no longer able to see it otherwiseand to crown all some unfathomable superciliousness give you the bedlamite hope that because you are able to tyrannize over yourselvesstoicism is selftyrannynature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over is not the stoic a part of nature but this is an old and everlasting story what happened in old time with the stoic still happens today a soon a ever a philosophy begin to believe in itself it always creates the world in it own image it can not do otherwise philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself the most spiritual will to power the will to creation of the world the will to the causa prima 10 the eagerness and subtlety i should even say craftiness with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at present throughout europe furnishes food for thought and attention and he who hears only a will to truth in the background and nothing else can not certainly boast of the sharpest ear in rare and isolated case it may really have happened that such a will to trutha certain extravagant and adventurous pluck a metaphysicians ambition of the forlorn hopehas participated therein that which in the end always prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful possibility there may even be puritanical fanatic of conscience who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing rather than in an uncertain something but that is nihilism and the sign of a despairing mortally wearied soul notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display it seems however to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinker who are still eager for life in that they side against appearance and speak superciliously of perspective in that they rank the credibility of their own body about a low a the credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stand still and thus apparently allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape for what doe one at present believe in more firmly than in one bodywho know if they are not really trying to win back something which wa formerly an even securer possession something of the old domain of the faith of former time perhaps the immortal soul perhaps the old god in short idea by which they could live better that is to say more vigorously and more joyously than by modern idea there is distrust of these modern idea in this mode of looking at thing a disbelief in all that ha been constructed yesterday and today there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn which can no longer endure the bricabrac of idea of the most varied origin such a socalled positivism at present throw on the market a disgust of the more refined taste at the villagefair motleyness and patchiness of all these realityphilosophasters in whom there is nothing either new or true except this motleyness therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical antirealists and knowledgemicroscopists of the present day their instinct which repels them from modern reality is unrefuted what do their retrograde bypath concern u the main thing about them is not that they wish to go back but that they wish to get away therefrom a little more strength swing courage and artistic power and they would be offand not back 11 it seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which kant exercised on german philosophy and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself kant wa first and foremost proud of his table of category with it in his hand he said this is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics let u only understand this could be he wa proud of having discovered a new faculty in man the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori granting that he deceived himself in this matter the development and rapid flourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible somethingat all event new facultiesof which to be still prouderbut let u reflect for a momentit is high time to do so how are synthetic judgment a priori possible kant asks himselfand what is really his answer by mean of a mean facultybut unfortunately not in five word but so circumstantially imposingly and with such display of german profundity and verbal flourish that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer people were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty and the jubilation reached it climax when kant further discovered a moral faculty in manfor at that time german were still moral not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact then came the honeymoon of german philosophy all the young theologian of the tubingen institution went immediately into the grovesall seeking for faculty and what did they not findin that innocent rich and still youthful period of the german spirit to which romanticism the malicious fairy piped and sang when one could not yet distinguish between finding and inventing above all a faculty for the transcendental schelling christened it intellectual intuition and thereby gratified the most earnest longing of the naturally piousinclined german one can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement which wa really youthfulness notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly in hoary and senile conception than to take it seriously or even treat it with moral indignation enough howeverthe world grew older and the dream vanished a time came when people rubbed their forehead and they still rub them today people had been dreaming and first and foremostold kant by mean of a mean facultyhe had said or at least meant to say but is thatan answer an explanation or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question how doe opium induce sleep by mean of a mean faculty namely the virtu dormitiva reply the doctor in moliere quia est in eo virtu dormitiva cujus est natura sensus assoupire but such reply belong to the realm of comedy and it is high time to replace the kantian question how are synthetic judgment a priori possible by another question why is belief in such judgment necessaryin effect it is high time that we should understand that such judgment must be believed to be true for the sake of the preservation of creature like ourselves though they still might naturally be false judgment or more plainly spoken and roughly and readilysynthetic judgment a priori should not be possible at all we have no right to them in our mouth they are nothing but false judgment only of course the belief in their truth is necessary a plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life and finally to call to mind the enormous influence which german philosophyi hope you understand it right to inverted comma goosefeethas exercised throughout the whole of europe there is no doubt that a certain virtu dormitiva had a share in it thanks to german philosophy it wa a delight to the noble idler the virtuous the mystic the artiste the threefourths christian and the political obscurantist of all nation to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this in shortsensus assoupire 12 a regard materialistic atomism it is one of the bestrefuted theory that have been advanced and in europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly a to attach serious signification to it except for convenient everyday use a an abbreviation of the mean of expressionthanks chiefly to the pole boscovich he and the pole copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponent of ocular evidence for while copernicus ha persuaded u to believe contrary to all the sen that the earth doe not stand fast boscovich ha taught u to abjure the belief in the last thing that stood fast of the earththe belief in substance in matter in the earthresiduum and particleatom it is the greatest triumph over the sen that ha hitherto been gained on earth one must however go still further and also declare war relentless war to the knife against the atomistic requirement which still lead a dangerous afterlife in place where no one suspect them like the more celebrated metaphysical requirement one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which christianity ha taught best and longest the soulatomism let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regard the soul a something indestructible eternal indivisible a a monad a an atomon this belief ought to be expelled from science between ourselves it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypothesesas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalist who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it but the way is open for new acceptation and refinement of the soulhypothesis and such conception a mortal soul and soul of subjective multiplicity and soul a social structure of the instinct and passion want henceforth to have legitimate right in science in that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstition which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul he is really a it were thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrustit is possible that the older psychologist had a merrier and more comfortable time of it eventually however he find that precisely thereby he is also condemned to inventand who know perhaps to discover the new 13 psychologist should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of selfpreservation a the cardinal instinct of an organic being a living thing seek above all to discharge it strengthlife itself is will to power selfpreservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent result thereof in short here a everywhere else let u beware of superfluous teleological principlesone of which is the instinct of selfpreservation we owe it to spinoza inconsistency it is thus in effect that method ordains which must be essentially economy of principle 14 it is perhaps just dawning on five or six mind that natural philosophy is only a worldexposition and worldarrangement according to u if i may say so and not a worldexplanation but in so far a it is based on belief in the sen it is regarded a more and for a long time to come must be regarded a morenamely a an explanation it ha eye and finger of it own it ha ocular evidence and palpableness of it own this operates fascinatingly persuasively and convincingly upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastesin fact it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism what is clear what is explained only that which can be seen and feltone must pursue every problem thus far obversely however the charm of the platonic mode of thought which wa an aristocratic mode consisted precisely in resistance to obvious senseevidenceperhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious sen than our contemporary but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining master of them and this by mean of pale cold grey conceptional network which they threw over the motley whirl of the sensesthe mob of the sen a plato said in this overcoming of the world and interpreting of the world in the manner of plato there wa an enjoyment different from that which the physicist of today offer usand likewise the darwinists and antiteleologists among the physiological worker with their principle of the smallest possible effort and the greatest possible blunder where there is nothing more to see or to grasp there is also nothing more for men to dothat is certainly an imperative different from the platonic one but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy laborious race of machinist and bridgebuilders of the future who have nothing but rough work to perform 15 to study physiology with a clear conscience one must insist on the fact that the senseorgans are not phenomenon in the sense of the idealistic philosophy a such they certainly could not be cause sensualism therefore at least a regulative hypothesis if not a heuristic principle what and others say even that the external world is the work of our organ but then our body a a part of this external world would be the work of our organ but then our organ themselves would be the work of our organ it seems to me that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum if the conception causa sui is something fundamentally absurd consequently the external world is not the work of our organ 16 there are still harmless selfobservers who believe that there are immediate certainty for instance i think or a the superstition of schopenhauer put it i will a though cognition here got hold of it object purely and simply a the thing in itself without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object i would repeat it however a hundred time that immediate certainty a well a absolute knowledge and the thing in itself involve a contradictio in adjecto we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of word the people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about thing but the philosopher must say to himself when i analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence i think i find a whole series of daring assertion the argumentative proof of which would be difficult perhaps impossible for instance that it is i who think that there must necessarily be something that think that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of a a cause that there is an ego and finally that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinkingthat i know what thinking is for if i had not already decided within myself what it is by what standard could i determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling in short the assertion i think assumes that i compare my state at the present moment with other state of myself which i know in order to determine what it is on account of this retrospective connection with further knowledge it ha at any rate no immediate certainty for mein place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the special case the philosopher thus find a series of metaphysical question presented to him veritable conscience question of the intellect to wit whence did i get the notion of thinking why do i believe in cause and effect what give me the right to speak of an ego and even of an ego a cause and finally of an ego a cause of thought he who venture to answer these metaphysical question at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception like the person who say i think and know that this at least is true actual and certainwill encounter a smile and two note of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays sir the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand it is improbable that you are not mistaken but why should it be the truth 17 with regard to the superstition of logician i shall never tire of emphasizing a small terse fact which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous mindsnamely that a thought come when it wish and not when i wish so that it is a perversion of the fact of the case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate think one think but that this one is precisely the famous old ego is to put it mildly only a supposition an assertion and assuredly not an immediate certainty after all one ha even gone too far with this one thinkseven the one contains an interpretation of the process and doe not belong to the process itself one infers here according to the usual grammatical formulato think is an activity every activity requires an agency that is active consequently it wa pretty much on the same line that the older atomism sought besides the operating power the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operatesthe atom more rigorous mind however learnt at last to get along without this earthresiduum and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves even from the logician point of view to get along without the little one to which the worthy old ego ha refined itself 18 it is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle mind it seems that the hundredtimesrefuted theory of the free will owes it persistence to this charm alone some one is always appearing who feel himself strong enough to refute it 19 philosopher are accustomed to speak of the will a though it were the bestknown thing in the world indeed schopenhauer ha given u to understand that the will alone is really known to u absolutely and completely known without deduction or addition but it again and again seems to me that in this case schopenhauer also only did what philosopher are in the habit of doinghe seems to have adopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it willing seems to me to be above all something complicated something that is a unity only in nameand it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks which ha got the mastery over the inadequate precaution of philosopher in all age so let u for once be more cautious let u be unphilosophical let u say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensation namely the sensation of the condition away from which we go the sensation of the condition towards which we go the sensation of this from and towards itself and then besides an accompanying muscular sensation which even without our putting in motion arm and leg commences it action by force of habit directly we will anything therefore just a sensation and indeed many kind of sensation are to be recognized a ingredient of the will so in the second place thinking is also to be recognized in every act of the will there is a ruling thoughtand let u not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing a if the will would then remain over in the third place the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking but it is above all an emotion and in fact the emotion of the command that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey i am free he must obeythis consciousness is inherent in every will and equally so the straining of the attention the straight look which fix itself exclusively on one thing the unconditional judgment that this and nothing else is necessary now the inward certainty that obedience will be renderedand whatever else pertains to the position of the commander a man who will command something within himself which render obedience or which he belief render obedience but now let u notice what is the strangest thing about the willthis affair so extremely complex for which the people have only one name inasmuch a in the given circumstance we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying party and a the obeying party we know the sensation of constraint impulsion pressure resistance and motion which usually commence immediately after the act of will inasmuch a on the other hand we are accustomed to disregard this duality and to deceive ourselves about it by mean of the synthetic term i a whole series of erroneous conclusion and consequently of false judgment about the will itself ha become attached to the act of willingto such a degree that he who will belief firmly that willing suffices for action since in the majority of case there ha only been exercise of will when the effect of the commandconsequently obedience and therefore actionwas to be expected the appearance ha translated itself into the sentiment a if there were a necessity of effect in a word he who will belief with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one he ascribes the success the carrying out of the willing to the will itself and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success freedom of willthat is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition who command and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the orderwho a such enjoys also the triumph over obstacle but think within himself that it wa really his own will that overcame them in this way the person exercising volition add the feeling of delight of his successful executive instrument the useful underwills or undersoulsindeed our body is but a social structure composed of many soulsto his feeling of delight a commander leffet cest moi what happens here is what happens in every wellconstructed and happy commonwealth namely that the governing class identifies itself with the success of the commonwealth in all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying on the basis a already said of a social structure composed of many soul on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willingassuch within the sphere of moralsregarded a the doctrine of the relation of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifest itself 20 that the separate philosophical idea are not anything optional or autonomously evolving but grow up in connection and relationship with each other that however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought they nevertheless belong just a much to a system a the collective member of the fauna of a continentis betrayed in the end by the circumstance how unfailingly the most diverse philosopher always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophy under an invisible spell they always revolve once more in the same orbit however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic will something within them lead them something impels them in definite order the one after the otherto wit the innate methodology and relationship of their idea their thinking is in fact far le a discovery than a rerecognizing a remembering a return and a homecoming to a faroff ancient commonhousehold of the soul out of which those idea formerly grew philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order the wonderful family resemblance of all indian greek and german philosophizing is easily enough explained in fact where there is affinity of language owing to the common philosophy of grammari mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functionsit can not but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical system just a the way seems barred against certain other possibility of worldinterpretation it is highly probable that philosopher within the domain of the uralaltaic language where the conception of the subject is least developed look otherwise into the world and will be found on path of thought different from those of the indogermans and mussulmans the spell of certain grammatical function is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuation and racial conditionsso much by way of rejecting locke superficiality with regard to the origin of idea 21 the causa sui is the best selfcontradiction that ha yet been conceived it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness but the extravagant pride of man ha managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly the desire for freedom of will in the superlative metaphysical sense such a still hold sway unfortunately in the mind of the halfeducated the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one action oneself and to absolve god the world ancestor chance and society therefrom involves nothing le than to be precisely this causa sui and with more than munchausen daring to pull oneself up into existence by the hair out of the slough of nothingness if any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether i beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will i mean nonfree will which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect one should not wrongly materialise cause and effect a the natural philosopher do and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which make the cause press and push until it effect it end one should use cause and effect only a pure conception that is to say a conventional fiction for the purpose of designation and mutual understandingnot for explanation in beinginitself there is nothing of casualconnection of necessity or of psychological nonfreedom there the effect doe not follow the cause there law doe not obtain it is we alone who have devised cause sequence reciprocity relativity constraint number law freedom motive and purpose and when we interpret and intermix this symbolworld a beinginitself with thing we act once more a we have always actedmythologically the nonfree will is mythology in real life it is only a question of strong and weak willsit is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker in every causalconnection and psychological necessity manifest something of compulsion indigence obsequiousness oppression and nonfreedom it is suspicious to have such feelingsthe person betrays himself and in general if i have observed correctly the nonfreedom of the will is regarded a a problem from two entirely opposite standpoint but always in a profoundly personal manner some will not give up their responsibility their belief in themselves the personal right to their merit at any price the vain race belong to this class others on the contrary do not wish to be answerable for anything or blamed for anything and owing to an inward selfcontempt seek to get out of the business no matter how the latter when they write book are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminal a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise and a a matter of fact the fatalism of the weakwilled embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose a la religion de la souffrance humaine that is it good taste 22 let me be pardoned a an old philologist who can not desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad mode of interpretation but nature conformity to law of which you physicist talk so proudly a thoughwhy it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad philology it is no matter of fact no text but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning with which you make abundant concession to the democratic instinct of the modern soul everywhere equality before the lawnature is not different in that respect nor better than we a fine instance of secret motive in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocraticlikewise a second and more refined atheismis once more disguised ni dieu ni maitrethat also is what you want and therefore cheer for natural lawis it not so but a ha been said that is interpretation not text and somebody might come along who with opposite intention and mode of interpretation could read out of the same nature and with regard to the same phenomenon just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claim of poweran interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all will to power before your eye that almost every word and the word tyranny itself would eventually seem unsuitable or like a weakening and softening metaphoras being too human and who should nevertheless end by asserting the same about this world a you do namely that it ha a necessary and calculable course not however because law obtain in it but because they are absolutely lacking and every power effect it ultimate consequence every moment granted that this also is only interpretationand you will be eager enough to make this objectionwell so much the better 23 all psychology hitherto ha run aground on moral prejudice and timidity it ha not dared to launch out into the depth in so far a it is allowable to recognize in that which ha hitherto been written evidence of that which ha hitherto been kept silent it seems a if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology a the morphology and developmentdoctrine of the will to power a i conceive of it the power of moral prejudice ha penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced and ha obviously operated in an injurious obstructive blinding and distorting manner a proper physiopsychology ha to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator it ha the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the good and the bad impulse cause a refined immorality distress and aversion in a still strong and manly consciencestill more so a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulse from bad one if however a person should regard even the emotion of hatred envy covetousness and imperiousness a lifeconditioning emotion a factor which must be present fundamentally and essentially in the general economy of life which must therefore be further developed if life is to be further developed he will suffer from such a view of thing a from seasickness and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge and there are in fact a hundred good reason why every one should keep away from it who can do so on the other hand if one ha once drifted hither with one bark well very good now let u set our teeth firmly let u open our eye and keep our hand fast on the helm we sail away right over morality we crush out we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thitherbut what do we matter never yet did a profounder world of insight reveal itself to daring traveler and adventurer and the psychologist who thus make a sacrificeit is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto on the contrarywill at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized a the queen of the science for whose service and equipment the other science exist for psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problem chapter ii the free spirit 24 o sanctum simplicitas in what strange simplification and falsification man life one can never cease wondering when once one ha got eye for beholding this marvel how we have made everything around u clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give our sen a passport to everything superficial our thought a godlike desire for wanton prank and wrong inferenceshow from the beginning we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartiness and gaietyin order to enjoy life and only on this solidified granitelike foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue not a it opposite butas it refinement it is to be hoped indeed that language here a elsewhere will not get over it awkwardness and that it will continue to talk of opposite where there are only degree and many refinement of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated tartuffery of moral which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood will turn the word round in the mouth of u discerning one here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seek most to retain u in this simplified thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitably falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it love error because a living itself it love life 25 after such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be heard it appeal to the most serious mind take care ye philosopher and friend of knowledge and beware of martyrdom of suffering for the truth sake even in your own defense it spoil all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience it make you headstrong against objection and red rag it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even worse consequence of enmity ye have at last to play your last card a protector of truth upon earthas though the truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature a to require protector and you of all people ye knight of the sorrowful countenance messrs loafer and cobwebspinners of the spirit finally ye know sufficiently well that it can not be of any consequence if ye just carry your point ye know that hitherto no philosopher ha carried his point and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special word and favourite doctrine and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping game before accuser and lawcourt rather go out of the way flee into concealment and have your mask and your ru that ye may be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared and pray do nt forget the garden the garden with golden trelliswork and have people around you who are a a gardenor a music on the water at eventide when already the day becomes a memory choose the good solitude the free wanton lightsome solitude which also give you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever how poisonous how crafty how bad doe every long war make one which can not be waged openly by mean of force how personal doe a long fear make one a long watching of enemy of possible enemy these pariah of society these longpursued badlypersecuted onesalso the compulsory recluse the spinoza or giordano brunosalways become in the end even under the most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware of it refined vengeanceseekers and poisonbrewers just lay bare the foundation of spinoza ethic and theology not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour ha left him the martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth force into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him and if one ha hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a martyr into a stageandtribunebawler only that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any casemerely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the continued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end supposing that every philosophy ha been a long tragedy in it origin 26 every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy where he is free from the crowd the many the majoritywhere he may forget men who are the rule a their exceptionexclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct a a discerner in the great and exceptional sense whoever in intercourse with men doe not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colour of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated taste supposing however that he doe not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains a i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then certain he wa not made he wa not predestined for knowledge for a such he would one day have to say to himself the devil take my good taste but the rule is more interesting than the exceptionthan myself the exception and he would go down and above all he would go inside the long and serious study of the average manand consequently much disguise selfovercoming familiarity and bad intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one equalsthat constitutes a necessary part of the lifehistory of every philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing part if he is fortunate however a a favourite child of knowledge should be he will meet with suitable auxiliary who will shorten and lighten his task i mean socalled cynic those who simply recognize the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness a to make them talk of themselves and their like before witnessessometimes they wallow even in book a on their own dunghill cynicism is the only form in which base soul approach what is called honesty and the higher man must open his ear to all the coarser or finer cynicism and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him or the scientific satyr speaks out there are even case where enchantment mix with the disgustnamely where by a freak of nature genius is bound to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape a in the case of the abbe galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also filthiest man of his centuryhe wa far profounder than voltaire and consequently also a good deal more silent it happens more frequently a ha been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an ape body a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no mean rare especially among doctor and moral physiologist and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man a a belly with two requirement and a head with one whenever any one see seek and want to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity a the real and only motif of human action in short when any one speaks badlyand not even illof man then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation for the indignant man and he who perpetually tear and lacerates himself with his own teeth or in place of himself the world god or society may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and selfsatisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary more indifferent and le instructive case and no one is such a liar a the indignant man 27 it is difficult to be understood especially when one think and life gangasrotogati footnote like the river ganges presto among those only who think and live otherwisenamely kurmagati

another is the tempo of it style which ha it basis in the character of the race or to speak more physiologically in the average tempo of the assimilation of it nutriment there are honestly meant translation which a involuntary vulgarization are almost falsification of the original merely because it lively and merry tempo which overleaps and obviates all danger in word and expression could not also be rendered a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language consequently also a may be reasonably inferred for many of the most delightful and daring nuance of free freespirited thought and just a the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him everything ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all longwinded and wearying specie of style are developed in profuse variety among germanspardon me for stating the fact that even goethe prose in it mixture of stiffness and elegance is no exception a a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs and a an expression of german taste at a time when there wa still a german taste which wa a rococotaste in moribus et artibus lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and wa versed in many thing he who wa not the translator of bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in the shadow of diderot and voltaire and still more willingly among the roman comedywriterslessing loved also freespiritism in the tempo and flight out of germany but how could the german language even in the prose of lessing imitate the tempo of machiavelli who in his principe make u breathe the dry fine air of florence and can not help presenting the most serious event in a boisterous allegrissimo perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he venture to presentlong heavy difficult dangerous thought and a tempo of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour finally who would venture on a german translation of petronius who more than any great musician hitherto wa a master of presto in invention idea and word what matter in the end about the swamp of the sick evil world or of the ancient world when like him one ha the foot of a wind the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which make everything healthy by making everything run and with regard to aristophanesthat transfiguring complementary genius for whose sake one pardon all hellenism for having existed provided one ha understood in it full profundity all that there requires pardon and transfiguration there is nothing that ha caused me to meditate more on plato secrecy and sphinxlike nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there wa found no bible nor anything egyptian pythagorean or platonicbut a book of aristophanes how could even plato have endured lifea greek life which he repudiatedwithout an aristophanes 29 it is the business of the very few to be independent it is a privilege of the strong and whoever attempt it even with the best right but without being obliged to do so prof that he is probably not only strong but also daring beyond measure he enters into a labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the danger which life in itself already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience supposing such a one come to grief it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize with it and he can not any longer go back he can not even go back again to the sympathy of men 30 our deepest insight mustand shouldappear a folly and under certain circumstance a crime when they come unauthorizedly to the ear of those who are not disposed and predestined for them the exoteric and the esoteric a they were formerly distinguished by philosophersamong the indian a among the greek persian and mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradation of rank and not in equality and equal rightsare not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in question view thing from below upwardswhile the esoteric class view thing from above downwards there are height of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically and if all the woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy and thus to a doubling of the woe that which serf the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human being the virtue of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher it might be possible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin to acquire quality thereby alone for the sake of which he would have to be honoured a a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk there are book which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according a the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the higher and more powerful make use of them in the former case they are dangerous disturbing unsettling book in the latter case they are heraldcalls which summon the bravest to their bravery book for the general reader are always illsmelling book the odour of paltry people cling to them where the populace eat and drink and even where they reverence it is accustomed to stink one should not go into church if one wish to breathe pure air 31 in our youthful year we still venerate and despise without the art of nuance which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and thing with yea and nay everything is so arranged that the worst of all taste the taste for the unconditional is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiment and prefers to try conclusion with the artificial a do the real artist of life the angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace until it ha suitably falsified men and thing to be able to vent it passion upon them youth in itself even is something falsifying and deceptive later on when the young soul tortured by continual disillusion finally turn suspiciously against itselfstill ardent and savage even in it suspicion and remorse of conscience how it upbraids itself how impatiently it tear itself how it revenge itself for it long selfblinding a though it had been a voluntary blindness in this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one sentiment one torture one enthusiasm with doubt one feel even the good conscience to be a danger a if it were the selfconcealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness and above all one espouses upon principle the cause against youtha decade later and one comprehends that all this wa also stillyouth 32 throughout the longest period of human historyone call it the prehistoric periodthe value or nonvalue of an action wa inferred from it consequence the action in itself wa not taken into consideration any more than it origin but pretty much a in china at present where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to it parent the retrooperating power of success or failure wa what induced men to think well or ill of an action let u call this period the premoral period of mankind the imperative know thyself wa then still unknownin the last ten thousand year on the other hand on certain large portion of the earth one ha gradually got so far that one no longer let the consequence of an action but it origin decide with regard to it worth a great achievement a a whole an important refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic value and of the belief in origin the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense a the moral one the first attempt at selfknowledge is thereby made instead of the consequence the originwhat an inversion of perspective and assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering to be sure an ominous new superstition a peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely thereby the origin of an action wa interpreted in the most definite sense possible a origin out of an intention people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of it intention the intention a the sole origin and antecedent history of an action under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present dayis it not possible however that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our mind with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of value owing to a new selfconsciousness and acuteness in manis it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguished negatively a ultramoral nowadays when at least among u immoralists the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lie precisely in that which is not intentional and that all it intentionalness all that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to it surface or skinwhich like every skin betrays something but conceals still more in short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom which first requires an explanationa sign moreover which ha too many interpretation and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone that morality in the sense in which it ha been understood hitherto a intentionmorality ha been a prejudice perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rank a astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be surmounted the surmounting of morality in a certain sense even the selfmounting of moralitylet that be the name for the longsecret labour which ha been reserved for the most refined the most upright and also the most wicked conscience of today a the living touchstone of the soul 33 it can not be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice for one neighbour and all selfrenunciationmorality must be mercilessly called to account and brought to judgment just a the aesthetic of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art nowadays seek insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiment for others and not for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here and for one asking promptly are they not perhapsdeceptionsthat they pleasehim who ha them and him who enjoys their fruit and also the mere spectatorthat is still no argument in their favour but just call for caution let u therefore be cautious 34 at whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays seen from every position the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eye can light upon we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure u into surmise concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of thing he however who make thinking itself and consequently the spirit responsible for the falseness of the worldan honourable exit which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avail himself ofhe who regard this world including space time form and movement a falsely deduced would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking ha it not hitherto been playing upon u the worst of scurvy trick and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it ha always been doing in all seriousness the innocence of thinker ha something touching and respectinspiring in it which even nowadays permit them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them honest answer for example whether it be real or not and why it keep the outer world so resolutely at a distance and other question of the same description the belief in immediate certainty is a moral naivete which doe honour to u philosopher butwe have now to cease being merely moral men apart from morality such belief is a folly which doe little honour to u if in middleclass life an everready distrust is regarded a the sign of a bad character and consequently a an imprudence here among u beyond the middleclass world and it yea and nay what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the philosopher ha at length a right to bad character a the being who ha hitherto been most befooled on earthhe is now under obligation to distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicionforgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression for i myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and i keep at least a couple of poke in the rib ready for the blind rage with which philosopher struggle against being deceived why not it is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world so much must be conceded there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimate and semblance and if with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosopher one wished to do away altogether with the seeming worldwell granted that you could do thatat least nothing of your truth would thereby remain indeed what is it that force u in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false is it not enough to suppose degree of seemingness and a it were lighter and darker shade and tone of semblancedifferent valeurs a the painter say why might not the world which concern usbe a fiction and to any one who suggested but to a fiction belongs an originatormight it not be bluntly replied why may not this belong also belong to the fiction is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject just a towards the predicate and object might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar all respect to governess but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governessfaith 35 o voltaire o humanity o idiocy there is something ticklish in the truth and in the search for the truth and if man go about it too humanelyil ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bieni wager he find nothing 36 supposing that nothing else is given a real but our world of desire and passion that we can not sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our impulsesfor thinking is only a relation of these impulse to one anotherare we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given doe not suffice by mean of our counterpart for the understanding even of the socalled mechanical or material world i do not mean a an illusion a semblance a representation in the berkeleyan and schopenhauerian sense but a possessing the same degree of reality a our emotion themselvesas a more primitive form of the world of emotion in which everything still lie locked in a mighty unity which afterwards branch off and develops itself in organic process naturally also refines and debilitatesas a kind of instinctive life in which all organic function including selfregulation assimilation nutrition secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with one anotheras a primary form of lifein the end it is not only permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of logical method not to assume several kind of causality so long a the attempt to get along with a single one ha not been pushed to it furthest extent to absurdity if i may be allowed to say so that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadaysit follows from it definition a mathematician say the question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will a operating whether we believe in the causality of the will if we do soand fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in causality itselfwe must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will a the only causality will can naturally only operate on willand not on matter not on nerve for instance in short the hypothesis must be hazarded whether will doe not operate on will wherever effect are recognizedand whether all mechanical action inasmuch a a power operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life a the development and ramification of one fundamental form of willnamely the will to power a my thesis put it granted that all organic function could be traced back to this will to power and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutritionit is one problemcould also be found therein one would thus have acquired the right to define all active force unequivocally a will to power the world seen from within the world defined and designated according to it intelligible characterit would simply be will to power and nothing else 37 what doe not that mean in popular language god is disproved but not the devilon the contrary on the contrary my friend and who the devil also compels you to speak popularly 38 a happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern time with the french revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous when judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary spectator of all europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately until the text ha disappeared under the interpretation so a noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make it aspect endurableor rather ha not this already happened have not we ourselves beenthat noble posterity and in so far a we now comprehend this is it notthereby already past 39 nobody will very readily regard a doctrine a true merely because it make people happy or virtuousexcepting perhaps the amiable idealist who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful and let all kind of motley coarse and goodnatured desirability swim about promiscuously in their pond happiness and virtue are no argument it is willingly forgotten however even on the part of thoughtful mind that to make unhappy and to make bad are just a little counterargument a thing could be true although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of itso that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could endureor to speak more plainly by the extent to which it required truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped and falsified but there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain portion of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success not to speak of the wicked who are happya specie about whom moralist are silent perhaps severity and craft are more favourable condition for the development of strong independent spirit and philosopher than the gentle refined yielding goodnature and habit of taking thing easily which are prized and rightly prized in a learned man presupposing always to begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to the philosopher who writes book or even introduces his philosophy into booksstendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the freespirited philosopher which for the sake of german taste i will not omit to underlinefor it is opposed to german taste pour etre bon philosophe say this last great psychologist il faut etre sec clair sans illusion un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du caractere requis pour faire de decouvertes en philosophie cestadire pour voir clair dans ce qui est 40 everything that is profound love the mask the profoundest thing have a hatred even of figure and likeness should not the contrary only be the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in a question worth askingit would be strange if some mystic ha not already ventured on the same kind of thing there are proceeding of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable there are action of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his recollection many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret shame is inventive they are not the worst thing of which one is most ashamed there is not only deceit behind a maskthere is so much goodness in craft i could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old green heavilyhooped winecask the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so a man who ha depth in his shame meet his destiny and his delicate decision upon path which few ever reach and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friend may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their eye and equally so his regained security such a hidden nature which instinctively employ speech for silence and concealment and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication desire and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the heart and head of his friend and supposing he doe not desire it his eye will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him thereand that it is well to be so every profound spirit need a mask nay more around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing to the constantly false that is to say superficial interpretation of every word he utters every step he take every sign of life he manifest 41 one must subject oneself to one own test that one is destined for independence and command and do so at the right time one must not avoid one test although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play and are in the end test made only before ourselves and before no other judge not to cleave to any person be it even the dearestevery person is a prison and also a recess not to cleave to a fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitousit is even le difficult to detach one heart from a victorious fatherland not to cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance ha given u an insight not to cleave to a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discovery apparently specially reserved for u not to cleave to one own liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which always fly further aloft in order always to see more under itthe danger of the flier not to cleave to our own virtue nor become a a whole a victim to any of our specialty to our hospitality for instance which is the danger of danger for highly developed and wealthy soul who deal prodigally almost indifferently with themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice one must know how to conserve oneselfthe best test of independence 42 a new order of philosopher is appearing i shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger a far a i understand them a far a they allow themselves to be understoodfor it is their nature to wish to remain something of a puzzlethese philosopher of the future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated a tempter this name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be preferred a temptation 43 will they be new friend of truth these coming philosopher very probably for all philosopher hitherto have loved their truth but assuredly they will not be dogmatist it must be contrary to their pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still be truth for every onethat which ha hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic effort my opinion is my opinion another person ha not easily a right to itsuch a philosopher of the future will say perhaps one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people good is no longer good when one neighbour take it into his mouth and how could there be a common good the expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of small value in the end thing must be a they are and have always beenthe great thing remain for the great the abyss for the profound the delicacy and thrill for the refined and to sum up shortly everything rare for the rare 44 need i say expressly after all this that they will be free very free spirit these philosopher of the futureas certainly also they will not be merely free spirit but something more higher greater and fundamentally different which doe not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken but while i say this i feel under obligation almost a much to them a to ourselves we free spirit who are their herald and forerunner to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog ha too long made the conception of free spirit obscure in every country of europe and the same in america there is at present something which make an abuse of this name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirit who desire almost the opposite of what our intention and instinct promptnot to mention that in respect to the new philosopher who are appearing they must still more be closed window and bolted door briefly and regrettably they belong to the leveller these wrongly named free spiritsas glibtongued and scribefingered slave of the democratic taste and it modern idea all of them men without solitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellow to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only they are not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery and failure in the old form in which society ha hitherto existeda notion which happily inverts the truth entirely what they would fain attain with all their strength is the universal greenmeadow happiness of the herd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of life for every one their

what wonder that we free spirit are not exactly the most communicative spirit that we do not wish to betray in every respect what a spirit can free itself from and where perhaps it will then be driven

attained the height depth and distance of these experience the entire history of the soul up to the present time and it still unexhausted possibility this is the preordained huntingdomain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt but how often must he say despairingly to himself a single individual ala only a single individual and this great forest this virgin forest so he would like to have some hundred of hunting assistant and fine trained hound that he could send into the history of the human soul to drive his game together in vain again and again he experience profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to find assistant and dog for all the thing that directly excite his curiosity the evil of sending scholar into new and dangerous huntingdomains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense are required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the big hunt and also the great danger commencesit is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose in order for instance to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of knowledge and conscience ha hitherto had in the soul of homines religiosi a person would perhaps himself have to posse a profound a bruised a immense an experience a the intellectual conscience of pascal and then he would still require that widespread heaven of clear wicked spirituality which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiencesbut who could do me this service and who would have time to wait for such servantsthey evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at all time eventually one must do everything oneself in order to know something which mean that one ha much to dobut a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vicespardon me i mean to say that the love of truth ha it reward in heaven and already upon earth 46 faith such a early christianity desired and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly freespirited world which had century of struggle between philosophical school behind it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which the imperium romanum gavethis faith is not that sincere austere slavefaith by which perhaps a luther or a cromwell or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his god and christianity it is much rather the faith of pascal which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reasona tough longlived wormlike reason which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow the christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom all pride all selfconfidence of spirit it is at the same time subjection selfderision and selfmutilation there is cruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to a tender manysided and very fastidious conscience it take for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful that all the past and all the habit of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum in the form of which faith come to it modern men with their obtuseness a regard all christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which wa implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula god on the cross hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so dreadful questioning and questionable a this formula it promised a transvaluation of all ancient valuesit wa the orient the profound orient it wa the oriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and it noble lightminded toleration on the roman catholicism of nonfaith and it wa always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the halfstoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith which made the slave indignant at their master and revolt against them enlightenment cause revolt for the slave desire the unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in moral he love a he hate without nuance to the very depth to the point of pain to the point of sicknesshis many hidden suffering make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering the skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality wa not the least of the cause also of the last great slaveinsurrection which began with the french revolution 47 wherever the religious neurosis ha appeared on the earth so far we find it connected with three dangerous prescription a to regimen solitude fasting and sexual abstinencebut without it being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or if any relation at all of cause and effect exists there this latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptom among savage a well a among civilized people is the most sudden and excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysm worldrenunciation and willrenunciation both symptom perhaps explainable a disguised epilepsy but nowhere is it more obligatory to put aside explanation around no other type ha there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophersperhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution or better still to look away to go awayyet in the background of the most recent philosophy that of schopenhauer we find almost a the problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening how is the negation of will possible how is the saint possiblethat seems to have been the very question with which schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher and thus it wa a genuine schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent perhaps also his last a far a germany is concerned namely richard wagner should bring his own lifework to an end just here and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage a kundry type vecu and a it loved and lived at the very time that the maddoctors in almost all european country had an opportunity to study the type close at hand wherever the religious neurosisor a i call it the religious moodmade it latest epidemical outbreak and display a the salvation armyif it be a question however a to what ha been so extremely interesting to men of all sort in all age and even to philosopher in the whole phenomenon of the saint it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous thereinnamely the immediate succession of opposite of state of the soul regarded a morally antithetical it wa believed here to be selfevident that a bad man wa all at once turned into a saint a good man the hitherto existing psychology wa wrecked at this point is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of moral because it believed in opposition of moral value and saw read and interpreted these opposition into the text and fact of the case what miracle only an error of interpretation a lack of philology 48 it seems that the latin race are far more deeply attached to their catholicism than we northerner are to christianity generally and that consequently unbelief in catholic country mean something quite different from what it doe among protestantsnamely a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race while with u it is rather a return to the spirit or nonspirit of the race we northerner undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous race even a regard our talent for religionwe have poor talent for it one may make an exception in the case of the celt who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for christian infection in the north the christian ideal blossomed forth in france a much a ever the pale sun of the north would allow it how strangely pious for our taste are still these later french skeptic whenever there is any celtic blood in their origin how catholic how ungerman doe auguste comte sociology seem to u with the roman logic of it instinct how jesuitical that amiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal saintebeuve in spite of all his hostility to jesuit and even ernest renan how inaccessible to u northerner doe the language of such a renan appear in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throw his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off it balance let u repeat after him these fine sentencesand what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably le beautiful but harder soul that is to say in our more german soulsdisons donc hardiment que la religion est un produit de lhomme normal que lhomme est le plus dans le vrai quant il

first impulse of rage on finding them i wrote on the margin la niaiserie religieuse par excellenceuntil in my later rage i even took a fancy to them these sentence with their truth absolutely inverted it is so nice and such a distinction to have one own antipode 49 that which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient greek is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which it pours forthit is a very superior kind of man who take such an attitude towards nature and lifelater on when the populace got the upper hand in greece fear became rampant also in religion and christianity wa preparing itself 50 the passion for god there are churlish honesthearted and importunate kind of it like that of lutherthe whole of protestantism lack the southern delicatezza there is an oriental exaltation of the mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave a in the case of st augustine for instance who lack in an offensive manner all nobility in bearing and desire there is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs for a unio mystica et physica a in the case of madame de guyon in many case it appears curiously enough a the disguise of a girl or youth puberty here and there even a the hysteria of an old maid also a her last ambition the church ha frequently canonized the woman in such a case 51 the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint a the enigma of selfsubjugation and utter voluntary privationwhy did they thus bow they divined in himand a it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearancethe superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation the strength of will in which they recognized their own strength and love of power and knew how to honour it they honoured something in themselves when they honoured the saint in addition to this the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion such an enormity of selfnegation and antinaturalness will not have been coveted for nothingthey have said inquiringly there is perhaps a reason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutor and visitor in a word the mighty one of the world learned to have a new fear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconquered enemyit wa the will to power which obliged them to halt before the saint they had to question him 52 in the jewish old testament the book of divine justice there are men thing and saying on such an immense scale that greek and indian literature ha nothing to compare with it one stand with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man wa formerly and one ha sad thought about old asia and it little outpushed peninsula europe which would like by all mean to figure before asia a the progress of mankind to be sure he who is himself only a slender tame houseanimal and know only the want of a houseanimal like our cultured people of today including the christian of cultured christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruinsthe taste for the old testament is a touchstone with respect to great and small perhaps he will find that the new testament the book of grace still appeal more to his heart there is much of the odour of the genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it to have bound up this new testament a kind of rococo of taste in every respect along with the old testament into one book a the bible a the book in itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit which literary europe ha upon it conscience 53 why atheism nowadays the father in god is thoroughly refuted equally so the judge the rewarder also his free will he doe not hearand even if he did he would not know how to help the worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he uncertainthis is what i have made out by questioning and listening at a variety of conversation to be the cause of the decline of european theism it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growthit reject the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust 54 what doe all modern philosophy mainly do since descartesand indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedurean attentat ha been made on the part of all philosopher on the old conception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conceptionthat is to say an attentat on the fundamental presupposition of christian doctrine modern philosophy a epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly antichristian although for keener ear be it said by no mean antireligious formerly in effect one believed in the soul a one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject one said i is the condition think is the predicate and is conditionedto think is an activity for which one must suppose a subject a cause the attempt wa then made with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out of this netto see if the opposite wa not perhaps true think the condition and i the conditioned i therefore only a synthesis which ha been made by thinking itself kant really wished to prove that starting from the subject the subject could not be provednor the object either the possibility of an apparent existence of the subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange to himthe thought which once had an immense power on earth a the vedanta philosophy 55 there is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many round but three of these are the most important once on a time men sacrificed human being to their god and perhaps just those they loved the bestto this category belong the firstling sacrifice of all primitive religion and also the sacrifice of the emperor tiberius in the mithragrotto on the island of capri that most terrible of all roman anachronism then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificed to their god the strongest instinct they possessed their nature this festal joy shine in the cruel glance of ascetic and antinatural fanatic finally what still remained to be sacrificed wa it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmony in future blessedness and justice wa it not necessary to sacrifice god himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity gravity fate nothingness to sacrifice god for nothingnessthis paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty ha been reserved for the rising generation we all know something thereof already 56 whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire ha long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the halfchristian halfgerman narrowness and stupidity in which it ha finally presented itself to this century namely in the form of schopenhauer philosophy whoever with an asiatic and superasiatic eye ha actually looked inside and into the most worldrenouncing of all possible mode of thoughtbeyond good and evil and no longer like buddha and schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of moralitywhoever ha done this ha perhaps just thereby without really desiring it opened his eye to behold the opposite ideal the ideal of the most worldapproving exuberant and vivacious man who ha not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which wa and is but wish to have it again a it wa and is for all eternity insatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the whole piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires the playand make it necessary because he always requires himself anewand make himself necessarywhat and this would not becirculus vitiosus deus 57 the

semiidleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for it favourite microscopic labour of selfexamination and for it soft placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the coming of god i mean the idleness with a good conscience the idleness of olden time and of blood to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is dishonouringthat it vulgarizes body and soulis not quite unfamiliar and that consequently the modern noisy timeengrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for unbelief more than anything else among these for instance who are at present living apart from religion in germany i find freethinker of diversified specie and origin but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation ha dissolved the religious instinct so that they no longer know what purpose religion serve and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment they feel themselves already fully occupied these good people be it by their business or by their pleasure not to mention the fatherland and the newspaper and their family duty it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasurefor it is impossible they say to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoil their temper they are by no mean enemy of religious custom should certain circumstance state affair perhaps require their participation in such custom they do what is required a so many thing are donewith a patient and unassuming seriousness and without much curiosity or discomfortthey live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a for or against in such matter among those indifferent person may be reckoned nowadays the majority of german protestant of the middle class especially in the great laborious centre of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious scholar and the entire university personnel with the exception of the theologian whose existence and possibility there always give psychologist new and more subtle puzzle to solve on the part of pious or merely churchgoing people there is seldom any idea of how much goodwill one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for a german scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole profession and a i have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to which he is compelled by his modern conscience incline him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity a regard religion with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit which he take for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the church it is only with the help of history not through his own personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deference in presence of religion but even when his sentiment have reached the stage of gratitude towards them he ha not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself a church or a piety perhaps even the contrary the practical indifference to religious matter in the midst of which he ha been born and brought up usually sublimate itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which shuns contact with religious men and thing and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompt him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with itevery age ha it own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other age may envy it and how much naiveteadorable childlike and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treat the religious man a a lower and le valuable type beyond before and above which he himself ha developedhe the little arrogant dwarf and mobman the sedulously alert headandhand drudge of idea of modern idea 59 whoever ha seen deeply into the world ha doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial it is their preservative instinct which teach them to be flighty lightsome and false here and there one find a passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure form in philosopher a well a in artist it is not to be doubted that whoever ha need of the cult of the superficial to that extent ha at one time or another made an unlucky dive beneath it perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt child the born artist who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to falsify it image a if taking wearisome revenge on it one might guess to what degree life ha disgusted them by the extent to which they wish to see it image falsified attenuated ultrified and deifiedone might reckon the homines religiosi among the artist a their highest rank it is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole century to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which divine that truth might be attained too soon before man ha become strong enough hard enough artist enough piety the life in god regarded in this light would appear a the most elaborate and ultimate product of the fear of truth a artistadoration and artistintoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsification a the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at any price perhaps there ha hitherto been no more effective mean of beautifying man than piety by mean of it man can become so artful so superficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longer offends 60 to love mankind for god sakethis ha so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind ha attained that love to mankind without any redeeming intention in the background is only an additional folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love ha first to get it proportion it delicacy it gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclinationwhoever first perceived and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered a it attempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time be holy and respected a the man who ha so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion 61 the philosopher a we free spirit understand himas the man of the greatest responsibility who ha the conscience for the general development of mankindwill use religion for his disciplining and educating work just a he will use the contemporary political and economic condition the selecting and disciplining influencedestructive a well a creative and fashioningwhich can be exercised by mean of religion is manifold and varied according to the sort of people placed under it spell and protection for those who are strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion is an additional mean for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authorityas a bond which bind ruler and subject in common betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience and in the case of the unique nature of noble origin if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life reserving to themselves only the more refined form of government over chosen disciple or member of an order religion itself may be used a a mean for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing grosser affair and for securing immunity from the unavoidable filth of all political agitation the brahmin for instance understood this fact with the help of a religious organization they secured to themselves the power of nominating king for the people while their sentiment prompted them to keep apart and outside a men with a higher and superregal mission at the same time religion give inducement and opportunity to some of the subject to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending rank and class in which through fortunate marriage custom volitional power and delight in selfcontrol are on the increase to them religion offer sufficient incentive and temptation to aspire to higher intellectuality and to experience the sentiment of authoritative selfcontrol of silence and of solitude asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable mean of educating and ennobling a race which seek to rise above it hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy and finally to ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service and general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion give invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heart ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy with something of transfiguration and embellishment something of justification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all the semianimal poverty of their soul religion together with the religious significance of life shed sunshine over such perpetually harassed men and make even their own aspect endurable to them it operates upon them a the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferer of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manner almost turning suffering to account and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity and buddhism a their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of thing and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to livethis very difficulty being necessary 62 to be sureto make also the bad counterreckoning against such religion and to bring to light their secret dangersthe cost is always excessive and terrible when religion do not operate a an educational and disciplinary medium in the hand of the philosopher but rule voluntarily and paramountly when they wish to be the final end and not a mean along with other mean among men a among all other animal there is a surplus of defective diseased degenerating infirm and necessarily suffering individual the successful case among men also are always the exception and in view of the fact that man is the animal not yet properly adapted to his environment the rare exception but worse still the higher the type a man represents the greater is the improbability that he will succeed the accidental the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifest itself most terribly in it destructive effect on the higher order of men the condition of whose life are delicate diverse and difficult to determine what then is the attitude of the two greatest religion abovementioned to the surplus of failure in life they endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved in fact a the religion for sufferer they take the part of these upon principle they are always in favour of those who suffer from life a from a disease and they would fain treat every other experience of life a false and impossible however highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care inasmuch a in applying to others it ha applied and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man the hitherto paramount religionsto give a general appreciation of themare among the principal cause which have kept the type of man upon a lower levelthey have preserved too much that which should have perished one ha to thank them for invaluable service and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the spiritual men of christianity have done for europe hitherto but when they had given comfort to the sufferer courage to the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless and when they had allured from society into convent and spiritual penitentiary the brokenhearted and distracted what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which mean in deed and in truth to work for the deterioration of the european race to reverse all estimate of valuethat is what they had to do and to shatter

observe the strangely painful equally coarse and refined comedy of european christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an epicurean god i should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing doe it not actually seem that some single will ha ruled over europe for eighteen century in order to make a sublime abortion of man he however who with opposite requirement no longer epicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind a exemplified in the european christian pascal for instance would he not have to cry aloud with rage pity and horror oh you bungler presumptuous pitiful bungler what have you done wa that a work for your hand how you have hacked and botched my finest stone what have you

europe at present is perhaps a subtle belated diverse sensitive and refined a the science of moral belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarsefingeredan interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist indeed the expression science of moral is in respect to what is designated thereby far too presumptuous and counter to good tastewhich is always a foretaste of more modest expression one ought to avow with the utmost fairness what is still necessary here for a long time what is alone proper for the present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiment of worth and distinction of worth which live grow propagate and perishand perhaps attempt to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common form of these living crystallizationsas preparation for a theory of type of morality to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest all the philosopher with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality a a science they wanted to give a basic to moralityand every philosopher hitherto ha believed that he ha given it a basis morality itself however ha been regarded a something given how far from their awkward pride wa the seemingly insignificant problemleft in dust and decayof a description of form of morality notwithstanding that the finest hand and sen could hardly be fine enough for it it wa precisely owing to moral philosopher knowing the moral fact imperfectly in an arbitrary epitome or an accidental abridgementperhaps a the morality of their environment their position their church their zeitgeist their climate and zoneit wa precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nation era and past age and were by no mean eager to know about these matter that they did not even come in sight of the real problem of moralsproblems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of many kind of morality in every science of moral hitherto strange a it may sound the problem of morality itself ha been omitted there ha been no suspicion that there wa anything problematic there that which philosopher called giving a basis to morality and endeavoured to realize ha when seen in a right light proved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing morality a new mean of it expression consequently just a matteroffact within the sphere of a definite morality yea in it ultimate motive a sort of denial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in questionand in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and vivisecting of this very faith hear for instance with what innocencealmost worthy of honourschopenhauer represents his own task and draw your conclusion concerning the scientificness of a science whose latest master still talk in the strain of child and old wife the principle he say page 136 of the grundprobleme der ethik footnote page 5455 of schopenhauer basis of morality translated by arthur b bullock ma 1903 the axiom about the purport of which all moralist are practically agreed neminem laede immo omnes quantum potes juvais really the proposition which all moral teacher strive to establish the real basis of ethic which ha been sought like the philosopher stone for centuriesthe difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be greatit is well known that schopenhauer also wa unsuccessful in his effort and whoever ha thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is will to power may be reminded that schopenhauer although a pessimist actuallyplayed the flute daily after dinner one may read about the matter in his biography a question by the way a pessimist a repudiator of god and of the world who make a halt at moralitywho assent to morality and play the flute to laedeneminem moral what is that reallya pessimist 187 apart from the value of such assertion a there is a categorical imperative in u one can always ask what doe such an assertion indicate about him who make it there are system of moral which are meant to justify their author in the eye of other people other system of moral are meant to tranquilize him and make him selfsatisfied with other system he want to crucify and humble himself with others he wish to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinctionthis system of moral help it author to forget that system make him or something of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps kant especially give u to understand by his moral that what is estimable in me is that i know how to obeyand with you it shall not be otherwise than with me in short system of moral are only a signlanguage of the emotion 188 in contrast to laisseraller every system of moral is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no objection unless one should again decree by some system of moral that all kind of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is essential and invaluable in every system of moral is that it is a long constraint in order to understand stoicism or port royal or puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every language ha attained to strength and freedomthe metrical constraint the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm how much trouble have the poet and orator of every nation given themselvesnot excepting some of the prose writer of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousnessfor the sake of a folly a utilitarian bungler say and thereby deem themselves wisefrom submission to arbitrary law a the anarchist say and thereby fancy themselves free even freespirited the singular fact remains however that everything of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly certainty which exists or ha existed whether it be in thought itself or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just a in conduct ha only developed by mean of the tyranny of such arbitrary law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely this is nature and naturaland not laisseraller every artist know how different from the state of letting himself go is his most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing and constructing in the moment of inspirationand how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand law which by their very rigidness and precision defy all formulation by mean of idea even the most stable idea ha in comparison therewith something floating manifold and ambiguous in it the essential thing in heaven and in earth is apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long obedience in the same direction there thereby result and ha always resulted in the long run something which ha made life worth living for instance virtue art music dancing reason spiritualityanything whatever that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine the long bondage of the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of idea the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rule of a church or a court or conformable to aristotelian premise the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a christian scheme and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the christian godall this violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness ha proved itself the disciplinary mean whereby the european spirit ha attained it strength it remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here a everywhere nature show herself a she is in all her extravagant and indifferent magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble that for century european thinker only thought in order to prove somethingnowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker who wish to prove somethingthat it wa always settled beforehand what wa to be the result of their strictest thinking a it wa perhaps in the asiatic astrology of former time or a it is still at the present day in the innocent christianmoral explanation of immediate personal event for the glory of god or for the good of the soulthis tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent stupidity ha educated the spirit slavery both in the coarser and the finer sense is apparently an indispensable mean even of spiritual education and discipline one may look at every system of moral in this light it is nature therein which teach to hate the laisseraller the too great freedom and implant the need for limited horizon for immediate dutiesit teach the narrowing of perspective and thus in a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development thou must obey some one and for a long time otherwise thou wilt come to grief and lose all respect for thyselfthis seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical a old kant wished consequently the otherwise nor doe it address itself to the individual what doe nature care for the individual but to nation race age and rank above all however to the animal man generally to mankind 189 industrious race find it a great hardship to be idle it wa a master stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom sunday to such an extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for his weekand workday againas a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated fast such a is also frequently found in the ancient world although a is appropriate in southern nation not precisely with respect to work many kind of fast are necessary and wherever powerful influence and habit prevail legislator have to see that intercalary day are appointed on which such impulse are fettered and learn to hunger anew viewed from a higher standpoint whole generation and epoch when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism seem like those intercalated period of restraint and fasting during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itselfat the same time also to purify and sharpen itself certain philosophical sect likewise admit of a similar interpretation for instance the stoa in the midst of hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with aphrodisiacal odourshere also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox why it wa precisely in the most christian period of european history and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiment that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amourpassion 190 there is something in the morality of plato which doe not really belong to plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might say in spite of him namely socratism for which he himself wa too noble no one desire to injure himself hence all evil is done unwittingly the evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do so however if he knew that evil is evil the evil man therefore is only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily make himgoodthis mode of reasoning savour of the populace who perceive only the unpleasant consequence of evildoing and practically judge that it is stupid to do wrong while they accept good a identical with useful and pleasant without further thought a regard every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it ha the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom errplato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenet of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into themhe the most daring of all interpreter who lifted the entire socrates out of the street a a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless and impossible modificationsnamely in all his own disguise and multiplicity in jest and in homeric language a well what is the platonic socrates if notgreek word inserted here 191 the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or more plainly of instinct and reasonthe question whether in respect to the valuation of thing instinct deserves more authority than rationality which want to appreciate and act according to motif according to a why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utilityit is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of socrates and had divided men mind long before christianity socrates himself following of course the taste of his talentthat of a surpassing dialecticiantook first the side of reason and in fact what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble athenian who were men of instinct like all noble men and could never give satisfactory answer concerning the motif of their action in the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity but whyhe said to himselfshould one on that account separate oneself from the instinct one must set them right and the reason alsoone must follow the instinct but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good argument this wa the real falseness of that great and mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he wa satisfied with a kind of selfoutwitting in fact he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgmentplato more innocent in such matter and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to himself at the expenditure of all his strengththe greatest strength a philosopher had ever expendedthat reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal to the good to god and since plato all theologian and philosopher have followed the same pathwhich mean that in matter of morality instinct or a christian call it faith or a i call it the herd ha hitherto triumphed unless one should make an exception in the case of descartes the father of rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the revolution who recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and descartes wa superficial 192 whoever ha followed the history of a single science find in it development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest process of all knowledge and cognizance there a here the premature hypothesis the fiction the good stupid will to belief and the lack of distrust and patience are first developedour sen learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and cautious organ of knowledge our eye find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more force more morality it is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new we hear strange music badly when we hear another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sound into word with which we are more familiar and conversantit wa thus for example that the german modified the spoken word arcubalista into armbrust crossbow our sen are also hostile and averse to the new and generally even in the simplest process of sensation the emotion dominatesuch a fear love hatred and the passive emotion of indolenceas little a a reader nowadays read all the single word not to speak of syllable of a pagehe rather take about five out of every twenty word at random and guess the probably appropriate sense to themjust a little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to it leaf branch colour and shape we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree even in the midst of the most remarkable experience we still do just the same we fabricate the greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate any event except a inventor thereof all this go to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote age we have beenaccustomed to lying or to express it more politely and hypocritically in short more pleasantlyone is much more of an artist than one is aware ofin an animated conversation i often see the face of the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me according to the thought he express or which i believe to be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the strength of my visual facultythe delicacy of the play of the muscle and of the expression of the eye must therefore be imagined by me probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all 193 quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise what we experience in dream provided we experience it often pertains at last just a much to the general belonging of our soul a anything actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we have a requirement more or le and finally in broad daylight and even in the brightest moment of our waking life we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dream supposing that someone ha often flown in his dream and that at last a soon a he dream he is conscious of the power and art of flying a his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who belief that on the slightest impulse he can actualize all sort of curve and angle who know the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards without effort or constraint a downwards without descending or loweringwithout troublehow could the man with such dreamexperiences and dreamhabits fail to find happiness differently coloured and defined even in his waking hour how could he failto long differently for happiness flight such a is described by poet must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular violent far too troublesome for him 194 the difference among men doe not manifest itself only in the difference of their list of desirable thingsin their regarding different good thing a worth striving for and being disagreed a to the greater or le value the order of rank of the commonly recognized desirable thingsit manifest itself much more in what they regard a actually having and possessing a desirable thing a regard a woman for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification serf a an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession see the questionableness the mere apparentness of such ownership and wish to have finer test in order to know especially whether the woman not only give herself to him but also give up for his sake what she ha or would like to haveonly then doe he look upon her a possessed a third however ha not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether the woman when she give up everything for him doe not perhaps do so for a phantom of him he wish first to be thoroughly indeed profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he venture to let himself be found out only then doe he feel the beloved one fully in his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when she love him just a much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability a for his goodness patience and spirituality one man would like to posse a nation and he find all the higher art of cagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose another with a more refined thirst for possession say to himself one may not deceive where one desire to possesshe is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the heart of the people i must therefore make myself known and first of all learn to know myself among helpful and charitable people one almost always find the awkward craftiness which first get up suitably him who ha to be helped a though for instance he should merit help seek just their help and would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them for all help with these conceit they take control of the needy a a property just a in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property one find them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity parent involuntarily make something like themselves out of their childrenthey call that education no mother doubt at the bottom of her heart that the child she ha borne is thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to his own idea and notion of worth indeed in former time father deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born a among the ancient german and like the father so also do the teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession the consequence is 195 the jewsa people born for slavery a tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nation a they themselves say and believethe jew performed the miracle of the inversion of valuation by mean of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millennium their prophet fused into one the expression rich godless wicked violent sensual and for the first time coined the word world a a term of reproach in this inversion of valuation in which is also included the use of the word poor a synonymous with saint and friend the significance of the jewish people is to be found it is with them that the slaveinsurrection in moral commences 196 it is to be inferred that there are countless dark body near the sunsuch a we shall never see among ourselves this is an allegory and the psychologist of moral read the whole starwriting merely a an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed 197 the beast of prey and the man of prey for instance caesar borgia are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long a one seek a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monster and growth or even an innate hell in themas almost all moralist have done hitherto doe it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropic among moralist and that the tropical man must be discredited at all cost whether a disease and deterioration of mankind or a his own hell and selftorture and why in favour of the temperate zone in favour of the temperate men the moral the mediocrethis for the chapter moral a timidity 198 all the system of moral which address themselves with a view to their happiness a it is calledwhat else are they but suggestion for behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in which the individual live recipe for their passion their good and bad propensity insofar a such have the will to power and would like to play the master small and great expediency and elaboration permeated with the musty odour of old family medicine and oldwife wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their formbecause they address themselves to all because they generalize where generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even seductive when they are overspiced and begin to smell dangerously especially of the other world that is all of little value when estimated intellectually and is far from being science much le wisdom but repeated once more and three time repeated it is expediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupidity stupiditywhether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotion which the stoic advised and fostered or the nomorelaughing and nomoreweeping of spinoza the destruction of the emotion by their analysis and vivisection which he recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotion to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied the aristotelianism of moral or even morality a the enjoyment of the emotion in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps a music or a love of god and of mankind for god sakefor in religion the passion are once more enfranchised provided that or finally even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotion a ha been taught by hafis and goethe the bold lettinggo of the rein the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional case of wise old codger and drunkard with whom it no longer ha much dangerthis also for the chapter moral a timidity 199 inasmuch a in all age a long a mankind ha existed there have also been human herd family alliance community tribe people state church and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who commandin view therefore of the fact that obedience ha been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is now innate in every one a a kind of formal conscience which give the command thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally refrain from something in short thou shalt this need try to satisfy itself and to fill it form with a content according to it strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes a an omnivorous appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into it ear by all sort of commandersparents teacher law class prejudice or public opinion the extraordinary limitation of human development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herdinstinct of obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command if one imagine this instinct increasing to it greatest extent commander and independent individual will finally be lacking altogether or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just a if they also were only obeying this condition of thing actually exists in europe at presenti call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class they know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executor of older and higher order of predecessor of the constitution of justice of the law or of god himself or they even justify themselves by maxim from the current opinion of the herd a first servant of their people or instrument of the public weal on the other hand the gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air a if he were the only kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his quality such a public spirit kindness deference industry temperance modesty indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and useful to the herd a the peculiarly human virtue in case however where it is believed that the leader and bellwether can not be dispensed with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commander by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitution for example are of this origin in spite of all what a blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeansof this fact the effect of the appearance of napoleon wa the last great proof the history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century ha attained in it worthiest individual and period 200 the man of an age of dissolution which mix the race with one another who ha the inheritance of a diversified descent in his bodythat is to say contrary and often not only contrary instinct and standard of value which struggle with one another and are seldom at peacesuch a man of late culture and broken light will on an average be a weak man his fundamental desire is that the war which is in him should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance epicurean or christian it is above all thing the happiness of repose of undisturbedness of repletion of final unityit is the sabbath of sabbath to use the expression of the holy rhetorician st augustine who wa himself such a manshould however the contrariety and conflict in such nature operate a an additional incentive and stimulus to lifeand if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instinct they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves that is to say the faculty of selfcontrol and selfdeception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable being those enigmatical men predestined for conquering and circumventing others the finest example of which are alcibiades and caesar with whom i should like to associate the first of european according to my taste the hohenstaufen frederick the second and among artist perhaps leonardo da vinci they appear precisely in the same period when that weaker type with it longing for repose come to the front the two type are complementary to each other and spring from the same cause 201 a long a the utility which determines moral estimate is only gregarious utility a long a the preservation of the community is only kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be no morality of love to one neighbour granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition of society all those instinct are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable name a virtue and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not a yet belong to the domain of moral valuationsthey are still ultramoral a sympathetic action for instance is neither called good nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the roman and should it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the re publica after all love to our neighbour is always a secondary matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our fear of our neighbour after the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external danger it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspective of moral valuation certain strong and dangerous instinct such a the love of enterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utilityunder other name of course than those here givenbut had to be fostered and cultivated because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemy are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strongwhen the outlet for them are lackingand are gradually branded a immoral and given over to calumny the contrary instinct and inclination now attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draw it conclusion how much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a disposition or an endowmentthat is now the moral perspective here again fear is the mother of moral it is by the loftiest and strongest instinct when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious conscience that the selfreliance of the community is destroyed it belief in itself it backbone a it were break consequently these very instinct will be most branded and defamed the lofty independent spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are felt to be danger everything that elevates the individual above the herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called evil the tolerant unassuming selfadapting selfequalizing disposition the mediocrity of desire attains to moral distinction and honour finally under very peaceful circumstance there is always le opportunity and necessity for training the feeling to severity and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begin to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and selfresponsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb and still more the sheep win respect there is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society itself take the part of him who injures it the part of the criminal and doe so in fact seriously and honestly to punish appears to it to be somehow unfairit is certain that the idea of punishment and the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should we still punish punishment itself is terriblewith these question gregarious morality the morality of fear draw it ultimate conclusion if one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear one would have done away with this morality at the same time it would no longer be necessary it would not consider itself any longer necessarywhoever examines the conscience of the presentday european will always elicit the same imperative from it thousand moral fold and hidden recess the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time or otherthe will and the way thereto is nowadays called progress all over europe 202 let u at once say again what we have already said a hundred time for people ear nowadays are unwilling to hear such truthsour truth we know well enough how offensive it sound when any one plainly and without metaphor count man among the animal but it will be accounted to u almost a crime that it is precisely in respect to men of modern idea that we have constantly applied the term herd herdinstincts and such like expression what avail is it we can not do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is we have found that in all the principal moral judgment europe ha become unanimous including likewise the country where european influence prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teachthey know today what is good and evil it must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which here think it know that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame and call itself good is the instinct of the herding human animal the instinct which ha come and is ever coming more and more to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instinct according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom morality in europe at present is herdinganimal morality and therefore a we understand the matter only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after which many other morality and above all higher morality are or should be possible against such a possibility against such a should be however this morality defends itself with all it strength it say obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing else is morality indeed with the help of a religion which ha humoured and flattered the sublimest desire of the herdinganimal thing have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangement the democratic movement is the inheritance of the christian movement that it tempo however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient one for those who are sick and distracted by the herdinginstinct is indicated by the increasingly furious howling and always le disguised teethgnashing of the anarchist dog who are now roving through the highway of european culture apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrat and revolutionideologues and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternityvisionaries who call themselves socialist and want a free society those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the autonomous herd to the extent even of repudiating the notion master and servantni dieu ni maitre say a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim every special right and privilege this mean ultimately opposition to every right for when all are equal no one need right any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice a though it were a violation of the weak unfair to the necessary consequence of all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy in their compassion for all that feel life and suffers down to the very animal up even to godthe extravagance of sympathy for god belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or allowing it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heartsoftening under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy a though it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax of mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present the great discharge from all the obligation of the past altogether at one in their belief in the community a the deliverer in the herd and therefore in themselves 203 we who hold a different beliefwe who regard the democratic movement not only a a degenerating form of political organization but a equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man a involving his mediocrising and depreciation where have we to fix our hope in new philosophersthere is no other alternative in mind strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimate of value to transvalue and invert eternal valuation in forerunner in men of the future who in the present shall fix the constraint and fasten the knot which will compel millennium to take new path to teach man the future of humanity a his will a depending on human will and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprise and collective attempt in rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which ha hitherto gone by the name of history the folly of the greatest number is only it last formfor that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that ha existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent being might look pale and dwarfed the image of such leader hovers before our eyesis it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirit the condition which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis the presumptive method and test by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power a to feel a constraint to these task a transvaluation of value under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass so a to bear the weight of such responsibility and on the other hand the necessity for such leader the dreadful danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degeneratethese are our real anxiety and gloom ye know it well ye free spirit these are the heavy distant thought and storm which sweep across the heaven of our life there are few pain so grievous a to have seen divined or experienced how an exceptional man ha missed his way and deteriorated but he who ha the rare eye for the universal danger of man himself deteriorating he who like u ha recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which ha hitherto played it game in respect to the future of mankinda game in which neither the hand nor even a finger of god ha participatedhe who divine the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of modern idea and still more under the whole of christoeuropean moralitysuffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared he see at a glance all that could still be made out of man through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human power and arrangement he know with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibility and how often in the past the type man ha stood in presence of mysterious decision and new pathshe know still better from his painfulest recollection on what wretched obstacle promising development of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to piece broken down sunk and become contemptible the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of the man of the futureas idealized by the socialistic fool and shallowpatesthis degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal or a they call it to a man of free society this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal right and claim is undoubtedly possible he who ha thought out this possibility to it ultimate conclusion know another loathing unknown to the rest of mankindand perhaps also a new mission chapter vi we scholar 204 at the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here a that which it ha always beennamely resolutely montrer s play according to balzaci would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and a if with the best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relation of science and philosophy i mean to say that one must have the right out of one own experienceexperience a it seems to me always implies unfortunate experienceto treat of such an important question of rank so a not to speak of colour like the blind or against science like woman and artist ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct and their shame it always find thing out the declaration of independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy is one of the subtler aftereffect of democratic organization and disorganization the selfglorification and selfconceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in it best springtimewhich doe not mean to imply that in this case selfpraise smell sweet here also the instinct of the populace cry freedom from all master and after science ha with the happiest result resisted theology whose handmaid it had been too long it now proposes in it wantonness and indiscretion to lay down law for philosophy and in it turn to play the masterwhat am i saying to play the philosopher on it own account my memorythe memory of a scientific man if you pleaseteems with the naivete of insolence which i have heard about philosophy and philosopher from young naturalist and old physician not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men the philologist and schoolmaster who are both the one and the other by profession on one occasion it wa the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic task and capability at another time it wa the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby on another occasion it wa the colourblindness of the utilitarian who see nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted system and an extravagant expenditure which doe nobody any good at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundaryadjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another time the disregard of individual philosopher which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally in fine i found most frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholar the evil aftereffect of some particular philosopher to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his scornful estimate of other philosopher having been got rid ofthe result being a general illwill to all philosophy such seems to me for instance the aftereffect of schopenhauer on the most modern germany by his unintelligent rage against hegel he ha succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of german from it connection with german culture which culture all thing considered ha been an elevation and a divining refinement of the historical sense but precisely at this point schopenhauer himself wa poor irreceptive and ungerman to the extent of ingeniousness on the whole speaking generally it may just have been the humanness alltoohumanness of the modern philosopher themselves in short their contemptibleness which ha injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the door to the instinct of the populace let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of heraclitus plato empedocles and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorite of the spirit were called and with what justice an honest man of science may feel himself of a better family and origin in view of such representative of philosophy who owing to the fashion of the present day are just a much aloft a they are down belowin germany for instance the two lion of berlin the anarchist eugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann it is especially the sight of those hotchpotch philosopher who call themselves realist or positivist which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosopher at the best are themselves but scholar and specialist that is very evident all of them are person who have been vanquished and brought back again under the dominion of science who at one time or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the more and it responsibilityand who now creditably rancorously and vindictively represent in word and deed disbelief in the mastertask and supremacy of philosophy after all how could it be otherwise science flourish nowadays and ha the good conscience clearly visible on it countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy ha gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced to a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of epoch and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even get beyond the threshold and rigorously denies itself the right to enterthat is philosophy in it last throe an end an agony something that awakens pity how could such a philosophyrule 205 the danger that beset the evolution of the philosopher are in fact so manifold nowadays that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity the extent and towering structure of the science have increased enormously and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even a a learner or will attach himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to his elevation that is to say to his superspection his circumspection and his despection or he get aloft too late when the best of his maturity and strength is past or when he is impaired coarsened and deteriorated so that his view his general estimate of thing is no longer of much importance it is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that make him hesitate and linger on the way he dread the temptation to become a dilettante a millepede a milleantenna he know too well that a a discerner one who ha lost his selfrespect no longer command no longer lead unless he should aspire to become a great playactor a philosophical cagliostro and spiritual ratcatcherin short a misleader this is in the last instance a question of taste if it ha not really been a question of conscience to double once more the philosopher difficulty there is also the fact that he demand from himself a verdict a yea or nay not concerning science but concerning life and the worth of lifehe learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict and he ha to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive perhaps disturbing and destroying experience often hesitating doubting and dumbfounded in fact the philosopher ha long been mistaken and confused by the multitude either with the scientific man and ideal scholar or with the religiously elevated desensualized desecularized visionary and godintoxicated man and even yet when one hears anybody praised because he life wisely or a a philosopher it hardly mean anything more than prudently and apart wisdom that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight a mean and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game but the genuine philosopherdoes it not seem so to u my friendslives unphilosophically and unwisely above all imprudently and feel the obligation and burden of a hundred attempt and temptation of lifehe risk himself constantly he play this bad game 206 in relation to the genius that is to say a being who either engenders or producesboth word understood in their fullest sensethe man of learning the scientific average man ha always something of the old maid about him for like her he is not conversant with the two principal function of man to both of course to the scholar and to the old maid one concedes respectability a if by way of indemnificationin these case one emphasizes the respectabilityand yet in the compulsion of this concession one ha the same admixture of vexation let u examine more closely what is the scientific man firstly a commonplace type of man with commonplace virtue that is to say a nonruling nonauthoritative and nonselfsufficient type of man he posse industry patient adaptableness to rank and file equability and moderation in capacity and requirement he ha the instinct for people like himself and for that which they requirefor instance the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour the claim to honour and consideration which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability the sunshine of a good name the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness with which the inward distrust which lie at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animal ha again and again to be overcome the learned man a is appropriate ha also malady and fault of an ignoble kind he is full of petty envy and ha a lynxeye for the weak point in those nature to whose elevation he can not attain he is confiding yet only a one who let himself go but doe not flow and precisely before the man of the great current he stand all the colder and more reservedhis eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy the worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable result from the instinct of mediocrity of his type from the jesuitism of mediocrity which labour instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man and endeavour to breakor still better to relaxevery bent bow to relax of course with consideration and naturally with an indulgent handto relax with confiding sympathy that is the real art of jesuitism which ha always understood how to introduce itself a the religion of sympathy 207 however gratefully one may welcome the objective spiritand who ha not been sick to death of all subjectivity and it confounded ipsisimosityin the end however one must learn caution even with regard to one gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit ha recently been celebrated a if it were the goal in itself a if it were salvation and glorificationas is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school which ha also in it turn good reason for paying the highest honour to disinterested knowledge the objective man who no longer curse and scold like the pessimist the ideal man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossom forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failure is assuredly one of the most costly instrument that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful he is only an instrument we may say he is a mirrorhe is no purpose in himself the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that want to be known with such desire only a knowing or reflecting implieshe wait until something come and then expands himself sensitively so that even the light footstep and glidingpast of spiritual being may not be lost on his surface and film whatever personality he still posse seems to him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much ha he come to regard himself a the passage and reflection of outside form and event he call up the recollection of himself with an effort and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other person he make mistake with regard to his own need and here only is he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack of companion and societyindeed he set himself to reflect on his suffering but in vain his thought already rove away to the more general case and tomorrow he know a little a he knew yesterday how to help himself he doe not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual complaisance with respect to all object and experience the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that come his way his habit of inconsiderate goodnature of dangerous indifference a to yea and nay ala there are enough of case in which he ha to atone for these virtue of hisand a man generally he becomes far too easily the caput mortuum of such virtue should one wish love or hatred from himi mean love and hatred a god woman and animal understand themhe will do what he can and furnish what he can but one must not be surprised if it should not be muchif he should show himself just at this point to be false fragile questionable and deteriorated his love is constrained his hatred is artificial and rather un tour de force a slight ostentation and exaggeration he is only genuine so far a he can be objective only in his serene totality is he still nature and natural his mirroring and eternally selfpolishing soul no longer know how to affirm no longer how to deny he doe not command neither doe he destroy je ne meprise presque rienhe say with leibniz let u not overlook nor undervalue the presque neither is he a model man he doe not go in advance of any one nor after either he place himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil if he ha been so long confounded with the philosopher with the caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization he ha had far too much honour and what is more essential in him ha been overlookedhe is an instrument something of a slave though certainly the sublimest sort of slave but nothing in himselfpresque rien the objective man is an instrument a costly easily injured easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus which is to be taken care of and respected but he is no goal not outgoing nor upgoing no complementary man in whom the rest of existence justifies itself no terminationand still le a commencement an engendering or primary cause nothing hardy powerful selfcentred that want to be master but rather only a soft inflated delicate movable pottersform that must wait for some kind of content and frame to shape itself theretofor the most part a man without frame and content a selfless man consequently also nothing for woman in parenthesi 208 when a philosopher nowadays make known that he is not a skeptici hope that ha been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spiritpeople all hear it impatiently they regard him on that account with some apprehension they would like to ask so many many question indeed among timid hearer of whom there are now so many he is henceforth said to be dangerous with his repudiation of skepticism it seems to them a if they heard some evilthreatening sound in the distance a if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere a dynamite of the spirit perhaps a newly discovered russian nihiline a pessimism bonae voluntatis that not only denies mean denial butdreadful thought practises denial against this kind of goodwilla will to the veritable actual negation of lifethere is a is generally acknowledged nowadays no better soporific and sedative than skepticism the mild pleasing lulling poppy of skepticism and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctor of the day a an antidote to the spirit and it underground noise are not our ear already full of bad sound say the skeptic a lover of repose and almost a a kind of safety police this subterranean nay is terrible be still ye pessimistic mole the skeptic in effect that delicate creature is far too easily frightened his conscience is schooled so a to start at every nay and even at that sharp decided yea and feel something like a bite thereby yea and naythey seem to him opposed to morality he love on the contrary to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness while perhaps he say with montaigne what do i know or with socrates i know that i know nothing or here i do not trust myself no door is open to me or even if the door were open why should i enter immediately or what is the use of any hasty hypothesis it might quite well be in good taste to make no hypothesis at all are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum is there not time enough for that ha not the time leisure oh ye demon can ye not at all wait the uncertain also ha it charm the sphinx too is a circe and circe too wa a philosopherthus doe a skeptic console himself and in truth he need some consolation for skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain manysided physiological temperament which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness it arises whenever race or class which have been long separated decisively and suddenly blend with one another in the new generation which ha inherited a it were different standard and valuation in it blood everything is disquiet derangement doubt and tentativeness the best power operate restrictively the very virtue prevent each other growing and becoming strong equilibrium ballast and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul that however which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescript is the will they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willingthey are doubtful of the freedom of the will even in their dream our presentday europe the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of class and consequently of race is therefore skeptical in all it height and depth sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which spring impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with gloomy aspect like a cloud overcharged with interrogative signsand often sick unto death of it will paralysis of will where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays and yet how bedecked oftentimes how seductively ornamented there are the finest gala dress and disguise for this disease and that for instance most of what place itself nowadays in the showcase a objectiveness the scientific spirit lart pour lart and pure voluntary knowledge is only deckedout skepticism and paralysis of willi am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the european diseasethe disease of the will is diffused unequally over europe it is worst and most varied where civilization ha longest prevailed it decrease according a the barbarian stillor againasserts his claim under the loose drapery of western culture it is therefore in the france of today a can be readily disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and france which ha always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crisis of it spirit into something charming and seductive now manifest emphatically it intellectual ascendancy over europe by being the school and exhibition of all the charm of skepticism the power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already somewhat stronger in germany and again in the north of germany it is stronger than in central germany it is considerably stronger in england spain and corsica associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skull in the latternot to mention italy which is too young yet to know what it want and must first show whether it can exercise will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where europe a it were flow back to asianamely in russia there the power to will ha been long stored up and accumulated there the willuncertain whether to be negative or affirmativewaits threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our physicist perhaps not only indian war and complication in asia would be necessary to free europe from it greatest danger but also internal subversion the shattering of the empire into small state and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i do not say this a one who desire it in my heart i should rather prefer the contraryi mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of russia that europe would have to make up it mind to become equally threateningnamely to acquire one will by mean of a new caste to rule over the continent a persistent dreadful will of it own that can set it aim thousand of year ahead so that the long spunout comedy of it pettystatism and it dynastic a well a it democratic manywilledness might finally be brought to a close the time for petty politics is past the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the worldthe compulsion to great politics 209 a to how far the new warlike age on which we european have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism i should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable which the lover of german history will already understand that unscrupulous enthusiast for big handsome grenadier who a king of prussia brought into being a military and skeptical geniusand therewith in reality the new and now triumphantly emerged type of german the problematic crazy father of frederick the great had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius he knew what wa then lacking in germany the want of which wa a hundred time more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social formhis illwill to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct men were lacking and he suspected to his bitterest regret that his own son wa not man enough there however he deceived himself but who would not have deceived himself in his place he saw his son lapsed to atheism to the esprit to the pleasant frivolity of clever frenchmenhe saw in the background the great bloodsucker the spider skepticism he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good and of a broken will that no longer command is no longer able to command meanwhile however there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticismwho know to what extent it wa encouraged just by his father hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitudethe skepticism of daring manliness which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest and made it first entrance into germany in the person of the great frederick this skepticism despises and nevertheless grasp it undermines and take possession it doe not believe but it doe not thereby lose itself it give the spirit a dangerous liberty but it keep strict guard over the heart it is the german form of skepticism which a a continued fredericianism risen to the highest spirituality ha kept europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the german spirit and it critical and historical distrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great german philologist and historical critic who rightly estimated were also all of them artist of destruction and dissolution a new conception of the german spirit gradually established itselfin spite of all romanticism in music and philosophyin which the leaning towards masculine skepticism wa decidedly prominent whether for instance a fearlessness of gaze a courage and sternness of the dissecting hand or a resolute will to dangerous voyage of discovery to spiritualized north pole expedition under barren and dangerous sky there may be good ground for it when warmblooded and superficial humanitarian cross themselves before this spirit cet esprit fataliste ironique mephistophelique a michelet call it not without a shudder but if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit which awakened europe out of it dogmatic slumber let u call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new oneand that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare with unbridled presumption to recommend the german to the interest of europe a gentle goodhearted weakwilled and poetical fool finally let u only understand profoundly enough napoleon astonishment when he saw goethe it reveals what had been regarded for century a the german spirit voila un hommethat wa a much a to say but this is a man and i only expected to see a german 210 supposing then that in the picture of the philosopher of the future some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptic in the lastmentioned sense something in them would only be designated therebyand not they themselves with equal right they might call themselves critic and assuredly they will be men of experiment by the name with which i ventured to baptize them i have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because a critic in body and soul they will love to make use of experiment in a new and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense in their passion for knowledge will they have to go further in daring and painful attempt than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve ofthere is no doubt these coming one will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous quality which distinguish the critic from the skeptic i mean the certainty a to standard of worth the conscious employment of a unity of method the wary courage the standingalone and the capacity for selfresponsibility indeed they will avow among themselves a delight in denial and dissection and a certain considerate cruelty which know how to handle the knife surely and deftly even when the heart bleeds they will be sterner and perhaps not always towards themselves only than humane people may desire they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them or elevate and inspire themthey will rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revel for the feeling they will smile those rigorous spirit when any one say in their presence that thought elevates me why should it not be true or that work enchants me why should it not be beautiful or that artist enlarges me why should he not be great perhaps they will not only have a smile but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous idealistic feminine and hermaphroditic and if any one could look into their inmost heart he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile christian sentiment with antique taste or even with modern parliamentarism the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosopher in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century critical discipline and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matter will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosopher of the future they may even make a display thereof a their special adornmentnevertheless they will not want to be called critic on that account it will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed a is so welcome nowadays that philosophy itself is criticism and critical scienceand nothing else whatever though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the positivist of france and germany and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of kant let u call to mind the title of his principal work our new philosopher will say notwithstanding that critic are instrument of the philosopher and just on that account a instrument they are far from being philosopher themselves even the great chinaman of konigsberg wa only a great critic 211 i insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical worker and in general scientific men with philosophersthat precisely here one should strictly give each his own and not give those far too much these far too little it may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those step upon which his servant the scientific worker of philosophy remain standing and must remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic and dogmatist and historian and besides poet and collector and traveler and riddlereader and moralist and seer and free spirit and almost everything in order to traverse the whole range of human value and estimation and that he may be able with a variety of eye and conscience to look from a height to any distance from a depth up to any height from a nook into any expanse but all these are only preliminary condition for his task this task itself demand something elseit requires him to create value the philosophical worker after the excellent pattern of kant and hegel have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuationsthat is to say former determination of value creation of value which have become prevalent and are for a time called truthswhether in the domain of the logical the political moral or the artistic it is for these investigator to make whatever ha happened and been esteemed hitherto conspicuous conceivable intelligible and manageable to shorten everything long even time itself and to subjugate the entire past an immense and wonderful task in the carrying out of which all refined pride all tenacious will can surely find satisfaction the real philosopher however are commander and lawgiver they say thus shall it be they determine first the whither and the why of mankind and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical worker and all subjugator of the pastthey grasp at the future with a creative hand and whatever is and wa becomes for them thereby a mean an instrument and a hammer their knowing is creating their creating is a lawgiving their will to truth iswill to powerare there at present such philosopher have there ever been such philosopher must there not be such philosopher some day 212 it is always more obvious to me that the philosopher a a man indispensable for the morrow and the day after the morrow ha ever found himself and ha been obliged to find himself in contradiction to the day in which he life his enemy ha always been the ideal of his day hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one call philosopherswho rarely regarded themselves a lover of wisdom but rather a disagreeable fool and dangerous interrogatorshave found their mission their hard involuntary imperative mission in the end however the greatness of their mission in being the bad conscience of their age in putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the very virtue of their age they have betrayed their own secret it ha been for the sake of a new greatness of man a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy indolence selfindulgence and selfneglect how much falsehood wa concealed under the most venerated type of contemporary morality how much virtue wa outlived they have always said we must remove hence to where you are least at home in the face of a world of modern idea which would like to confine every one in a corner in a specialty a philosopher if there could be philosopher nowadays would be compelled to place the greatness of man the conception of greatness precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his allroundness he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the extent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age a weakness of will consequently in the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception of greatness with a good a right a the opposite doctrine with it ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity wa suited to an opposite agesuch a the sixteenth century which suffered from it accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrent and flood of selfishness in the time of socrates among men only of wornout instinct old conservative athenian who let themselves gofor the sake of happiness a they said for the sake of pleasure a their conduct indicatedand who had continually on their lip the old pompous word to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led irony wa perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh a into the flesh and heart of the noble with a look that said plainly enough do not dissemble before me herewe are equal at present on the contrary when throughout europe the herdinganimal alone attains to honour and dispenses honour when equality of right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrongi mean to say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordlinessat present it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble to wish to be apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good and evil the master of his virtue and of superabundance of will precisely this shall be called greatness a diversified a can be entire a ample a can be full and to ask once more the question is greatness possiblenowadays 213 it is difficult to learn what a philosopher is because it can not be taught one must know it by experienceor one should have the pride not to know it the fact that at present people all talk of thing of which they can not have any experience is true more especially and unfortunately a concern the philosopher and philosophical mattersthe very few know them are permitted to know them and all popular idea about them are false thus for instance the truly philosophical combination of a bold exuberant spirituality which run at presto pace and a dialectic rigour and necessity which make no false step is unknown to most thinker and scholar from their own experience and therefore should any one speak of it in their presence it is incredible to them they conceive of every necessity a troublesome a a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint thinking itself is regarded by them a something slow and hesitating almost a a trouble and often enough a worthy of the sweat of the noblebut not at all a something easy and divine closely related to dancing and exuberance to think and to take a matter seriously arduouslythat is one and the same thing to them such only ha been their experienceartists have here perhaps a finer intuition they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything arbitrarily and everything of necessity their feeling of freedom of subtlety of power of creatively fixing disposing and shaping reach it climaxin short that necessity and freedom of will are then the same thing with them there is in fine a gradation of rank in psychical state to which the gradation of rank in the problem corresponds and the highest problem repel ruthlessly every one who venture too near them without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality of what use is it for nimble everyday intellect or clumsy honest mechanic and empiricist to press in their plebeian ambition close to such problem and a it were into this holy of holiesas so often happens nowadays but coarse foot must never tread upon such carpet this is provided for in the primary law of thing the door remain closed to those intruder though they may dash and break their head thereon people have always to be born to a high station or more definitely they have to be bred for it a person ha only a right to philosophytaking the word in it higher significancein virtue of his descent the ancestor the blood decide here also many generation must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher each of his virtue must have been separately acquired nurtured transmitted and embodied not only the bold easy delicate course and current of his thought but above all the readiness for great responsibility the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duty and virtue the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated be it god or devil the delight and practice of supreme justice the art of commanding the amplitude of will the lingering eye which rarely admires rarely look up rarely love chapter vii our virtue 214 our virtuesit is probable that we too have still our virtue although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtue on account of which we hold our grandfather in esteem and also at a little distance from u we european of the day after tomorrow we firstlings of the twentieth centurywith all our dangerous curiosity our multifariousness and art of disguising our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spiritwe shall presumably if we must have virtue have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclination with our most ardent requirement well then let u look for them in our labyrinthswhere a we know so many thing lose themselves so many thing get quite lost and is there anything finer than to search for one own virtue is it not almost to believe in one own virtue but this believing in one own virtuesis it not practically the same a what wa formerly called one good conscience that long respectable pigtail of an idea which our grandfather used to hang behind their head and often enough also behind their understanding it seems therefore that however little we may imagine ourselves to be oldfashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respect in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchild of our grandfather we last european with good conscience we also still wear their pigtailah if you only knew how soon so very soonit will be different 215 a in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two sun which determine the path of one planet and in certain case sun of different colour shine around a single planet now with red light now with green and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colour so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our firmament are determined by different morality our action shine alternately in different colour and are seldom unequivocaland there are often case also in which our action are motleycoloured 216 to love one enemy i think that ha been well learnt it take place thousand of time at present on a large and small scale indeed at time the higher and sublimer thing take placewe learn to despise when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however unconsciously without noise without ostentation with the shame and secrecy of goodness which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue morality a attitudeis opposed to our taste nowadays this is also an advance a it wa an advance in our father that religion a an attitude finally became opposed to their taste including the enmity and voltairean bitterness against religion and all that formerly belonged to freethinkerpantomime it is the music in our conscience the dance in our spirit to which puritan litany moral sermon and goodygoodness wo nt chime 217 let u be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment they never forgive u if they have once made a mistake before u or even with regard to usthey inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractor even when they still remain our friendsblessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunder 218 the psychologist of franceand where else are there still psychologist nowadayshave never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise just a though in short they betray something thereby flaubert for instance the honest citizen of rouen neither saw heard nor tasted anything else in the end it wa his mode of selftorment and refined cruelty a this is growing wearisome i would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasurenamely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirit and the task they have to perform the subtle barbed jesuitical astuteness which is a thousand time subtler than the taste and understanding of the middleclass in it best momentssubtler even than the understanding of it victimsa repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kind of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered in short you psychologist study the philosophy of the rule in it struggle with the exception there you have a spectacle fit for god and godlike malignity or in plainer word practise vivisection on good people on the homo bonae voluntatis on yourselves 219 the practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are le so it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming subtlemalice spiritualises they are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are overendowed with intellectual good and privilege are equal to them they contend for the equality of all before god and almost need the belief in god for this purpose it is among them that the most powerful antagonist of atheism are found if any one were to say to them a lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral manit would make them furious i shall take care not to say so i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only a the ultimate product of moral quality that it is a synthesis of all quality attributed to the merely moral man after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice perhaps during a whole series of generation that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice and the beneficent severity which know that it is authorized to maintain gradation of rank in the world even among thingsand not only among men 220 now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular one mustprobably not without some dangerget an idea of what people actually take an interest in and what are the thing generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary menincluding the cultured even the learned and perhaps philosopher also if appearance do not deceive the fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interest and charm higher nature and more refined and fastidious taste seems absolutely uninteresting to the average manif notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these interest he call it desinteresse and wonder how it is possible to act disinterestedly there have been philosopher who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical otherworldly expression perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that disinterested action is very interesting and interested action provided that and lovewhat even an action for love sake shall be unegoistic but you fool and the praise of the selfsacrificerbut whoever ha really offered sacrifice know that he wanted and obtained something for itperhaps something from himself for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have more there perhaps in general to be more or even feel himself more but this is a realm of question and answer in which a more fastidious spirit doe not like to stay for here truth ha to stifle her yawn so much when she is obliged to answer and after all truth is a woman one must not use force with her 221 it sometimes happens said a moralistic pedant and trifleretailer that i honour and respect an unselfish man not however because he is unselfish but because i think he ha a right to be useful to another man at his own expense in short the question is always who he is and who the other is for instance in a person created and destined for command selfdenial and modest retirement instead of being virtue would be the waste of virtue so it seems to me every system of unegoistic morality which take itself unconditionally and appeal to every one not only sin against good taste but is also an incentive to sin of omission an additional seduction under the mask of philanthropyand precisely a seduction and injury to the higher rarer and more privileged type of men moral system must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradation of rank their presumption must be driven home to their conscienceuntil they thoroughly understand at last that it is immoral to say that what is right for one is proper for anotherso said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted system of moral to practise morality but one should not be too much in the right if one wish to have the laugher on one own side a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste 222 wherever sympathy fellowsuffering is preached nowadaysand if i gather rightly no other religion is any longer preachedlet the psychologist have his ear open through all the vanity through all the noise which is natural to these preacher a to all preacher he will hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of selfcontempt it belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe which ha been on the increase for a century the first symptom of which are already specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madame depinayif it is not really the cause thereof the man of modern idea the conceited ape is excessively dissatisfied with himselfthis is perfectly certain he suffers and his vanity want him only to suffer with his fellow 223 the hybrid europeana tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in allabsolutely requires a costume he need history a a storeroom of costume to be sure he notice that none of the costume fit him properlyhe change and change let u look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preference and change in it masquerade of style and also with respect to it moment of desperation on account of nothing suiting u it is in vain to get ourselves up a romantic or classical or christian or florentine or barocco or national in moribus et artibus it doe not clothe u but the spirit especially the historical spirit profit even by this desperation once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested put on taken off packed up and above all studiedwe are the first studious age in puncto of costume i mean a concern moral article of belief artistic taste and religion we are prepared a no other age ha ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the most spiritual festivallaughter and arrogance for the transcendental height of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the domain where even we can still be original probably a parodist of the world history and a god merryandrewsperhaps though nothing else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a future 224 the historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuation according to which a people a community or an individual ha lived the divining instinct for the relationship of these valuation for the relation of the authority of the valuation to the authority of the operating forcesthis historical sense which we european claim a our specialty ha come to u in the train of the enchanting and mad semibarbarity into which europe ha been plunged by the democratic mingling of class and racesit is only the nineteenth century that ha recognized this faculty a it sixth sense owing to this mingling the past of every form and mode of life and of culture which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another flow forth into u modern soul our instinct now run back in all direction we ourselves are a kind of chaos in the end a we have said the spirit perceives it advantage therein by mean of our semibarbarity in body and in desire we have secret access everywhere such a a noble age never had we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilization and to every form of semibarbarity that ha at any time existed on earth and in so far a the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto ha just been semibarbarity the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything whereby it immediately prof itself to be an ignoble sense for instance we enjoy homer once more it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer whom men of distinguished culture a the french of the seventeenth century like saintevremond who reproached him for his esprit vaste and even voltaire the last echo of the century can not and could not so easily appropriatewhom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy the very decided yea and nay of their palate their promptly ready disgust their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity and in general the averseness of every distinguished and selfsufficing culture to avow a new desire a dissatisfaction with it own condition or an admiration of what is strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best thing of the world which are not their property or could not become their preyand no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense with it truckling plebeian curiosity the case is not different with shakespeare that marvelous spanishmoorishsaxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient athenian of the circle of aeschylus would have halfkilled himself with laughter or irritation but weaccept precisely this wild motleyness this medley of the most delicate the most coarse and the most artificial with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it a a refinement of art reserved expressly for u and allow ourselves to be a little disturbed by the repulsive fume and the proximity of the english populace in which shakespeare art and taste life a perhaps on the chiaja of naples where with all our sen awake we go our way enchanted and voluntarily in spite of the drainodour of the lower quarter of the town that a men of the historical sense we have our virtue is not to be disputedwe are unpretentious unselfish modest brave habituated to selfcontrol and selfrenunciation very grateful very patient very complaisantbut with all this we are perhaps not very tasteful let u finally confess it that what is most difficult for u men of the historical sense to grasp feel taste and love what find u fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art the essentially noble in work and men their moment of smooth sea and halcyon selfsufficiency the goldenness and coldness which all thing show that have perfected themselves perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and happy godsend and glorification of human life a they shine here and there those moment and marvelous experience when a great power ha voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinitewhen a superabundance of refined delight ha been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground proportionateness is strange to u let u confess it to ourselves our itching is really the itching for the infinite the immeasurable like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the rein fall before the infinite we modern men we semibarbariansand are only in our highest bliss when weare in most danger 225 whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism all those mode of thinking which measure the worth of thing according to pleasure and pain that is according to accompanying circumstance and secondary consideration are plausible mode of thought and naivete which every one conscious of creative power and an artist conscience will look down upon with scorn though not without sympathy sympathy for youto be sure that is not sympathy a you understand it it is not sympathy for social distress for society with it sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around u still le is it sympathy for the grumbling vexed revolutionary slaveclasses who strive after powerthey call it freedom our sympathy is a loftier and furthersighted sympathywe see how man dwarf himself how you dwarf him and there are moment when we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish when we resist itwhen we regard your seriousness a more dangerous than any kind of levity you want if possibleand there is not a more foolish if possibleto do away with suffering and weit really seems that we would rather have it increased and made worse than it ha ever been wellbeing a you understand itis certainly not a goal it seems to u an end a condition which at once render man ludicrous and contemptibleand make his destruction desirable the discipline of suffering of great sufferingknow ye not that it is only this discipline that ha produced all the elevation of humanity hitherto the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it it energy it shuddering in view of rack and ruin it inventiveness and bravery in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness ha been bestowed upon the soulhas it not been bestowed through suffering through the discipline of great suffering in man creature and creator are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh daydo ye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the creature in man applies to that which ha to be fashioned bruised forged stretched roasted annealed refinedto that which must necessarily suffer and is meant to suffer and our sympathydo ye not understand what our reverse sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy a the worst of all pampering and enervationso it is sympathy against sympathybut to repeat it once more there are higher problem than the problem of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all system of philosophy which deal only with these are naivete 226 we immoraliststhis world with which we are concerned in which we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every respect captious insidious sharp and tenderyes it is well protected from clumsy spectator and familiar curiosity we are woven into a strong net and garment of duty and can not disengage ourselvesprecisely here we are men of duty even we occasionally it is true we dance in our chain and betwixt our sword it is none the le true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstance and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot but do what we will fool and appearance say of u these are men without dutywe have always fool and appearance against u 227 honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we can not rid ourselves we free spiritswell we will labour at it with all our perversity and love and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our virtue which alone remains may it glance some day overspread like a gilded blue mocking twilight this aging civilization with it dull gloomy seriousness and if nevertheless our honesty should one day grow weary and sigh and stretch it limb and find u too hard and would fain have it pleasanter easier and gentler like an agreeable vice let u remain hard we latest stoic and let u send to it help whatever devilry we have in usour disgust at the clumsy and undefined our nitimur in vetitum our love of adventure our sharpened and fastidious curiosity our most subtle disguised intellectual will to power

228 i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto ha been tedious and ha belonged to the soporific appliancesand that virtue in my opinion ha been more injured by the tediousness of it advocate than by anything else at the same time however i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness it is desirable that a few people a possible should reflect upon moral and consequently it is very desirable that moral should not some day become interesting but let u not be afraid thing still remain today a they have always been i see no one in europe who ha or discloses an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning moral might be conducted in a dangerous captious and ensnaring mannerthat calamity might be involved therein observe for example the indefatigable inevitable english utilitarian how ponderously and respectably they stalk on stalk along a homeric metaphor express it better in the footstep of bentham just a he had already stalked in the footstep of the respectable helvetius no he wa not a dangerous man helvetius ce senateur pococurante to use an expression of galiani no new thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought not even a proper history of what ha been previously thought on the subject an impossible literature taking it all in all unless one know how to leaven it with some mischief in effect the old english vice called cant which is moral tartuffism ha insinuated itself also into these moralist whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motif if one must read them concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit moreover there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pang of conscience from which a race of former puritan must naturally suffer in all their scientific tinkering with moral is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan that is to say a a thinker who regard morality a questionable a worthy of interrogation in short a a problem is moralizing notimmoral in the end they all want english morality to be recognized a authoritative inasmuch a mankind or the general utility or the happiness of the greatest numberno the happiness of england will be best served thereby they would like by all mean to convince themselves that the striving after english happiness i mean after comfort and fashion and in the highest instance a seat in parliament is at the same time the true path of virtue in fact that in so far a there ha been virtue in the world hitherto it ha just consisted in such striving not one of those ponderous consciencestricken herdinganimals who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism a conducive to the general welfare want to have any knowledge or inkling of the fact that the general welfare is no ideal no goal no notion that can be at all grasped but is only a nostrumthat what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men in short that there is a distinction of rank between man and man and consequently between morality and morality they are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre specie of men these utilitarian englishman and a already remarked in so far a they are tedious one can not think highly enough of their utility one ought even to encourage them a ha been partially attempted in the following rhyme hail ye worthy barrowwheeling longerbetter aye revealing stiffer aye in head and knee unenraptured never jesting mediocre everlasting sans genie et sans esprit 229 in these later age which may be proud of their humanity there still remains so much fear so much superstition of the fear of the cruel wild beast the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner agesthat even obvious truth a if by the agreement of century have long remained unuttered because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again i perhaps risk something when i allow such a truth to escape let others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment footnote an expression from schiller william tell act iv scene 3 to drink that it will lie down quiet and forgotten in it old cornerone ought to learn anew about cruelty and open one eye one ought at last to learn impatience in order that such immodest gross errorsas for instance have been fostered by ancient and modern philosopher with regard to tragedymay no longer wander about virtuously and boldly almost everything that we call higher culture is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of crueltythis is my thesis the wild beast ha not been slain at all it life it flourish it ha only beentransfigured that which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty that which operates agreeably in socalled tragic sympathy and at the basis even of everything sublime up to the highest and most delicate thrill of metaphysics obtains it sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty what the roman enjoys in the arena the christian in the ecstasy of the cross the spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake or of the bullfight the presentday japanese who press his way to the tragedy the workman of the parisian suburb who ha a homesickness for bloody revolution the wagnerienne who with unhinged will undergoes the performance of tristan and isoldewhat all these enjoy and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in is the philtre of the great circe cruelty here to be sure we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former time which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of others there is an abundant superabundant enjoyment even in one own suffering in causing one own sufferingand wherever man ha allowed himself to be persuaded to selfdenial in the religious sense or to selfmutilation a among the phoenician and ascetic or in general to desensualisation decarnalisation and contrition to puritanical repentancespasms to vivisection of conscience and to pascallike sacrifizia dell intelleto he is secretly allured and impelled forward by his cruelty by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towards himselffinally let u consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates a an artist and glorifier of cruelty in that he compels his spirit to perceive against it own inclination and often enough against the wish of his hearthe force it to say nay where he would like to affirm love and adore indeed every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally is a violation an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit which instinctively aim at appearance and superficialityeven in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty 230 perhaps what i have said here about a fundamental will of the spirit may not be understood without further detail i may be allowed a word of explanationthat imperious something which is popularly called the spirit wish to be master internally and externally and to feel itself master it ha the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity a binding taming imperious and essentially ruling will it requirement and capacity here are the same a those assigned by physiologist to everything that life grows and multiplies the power of the spirit to appropriate foreign element reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old to simplify the manifold to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory just a it arbitrarily reunderlines make prominent and falsifies for itself certain trait and line in the foreign element in every portion of the outside world it object thereby is the incorporation of new experience the assortment of new thing in the old arrangementsin short growth or more properly the feeling of growth the feeling of increased poweris it object this same will ha at it service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance of arbitrary shutting out a closing of window an inner denial of this or that a prohibition to approach a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable a contentment with obscurity with the shuttingin horizon an acceptance and approval of ignorance a that which is all necessary according to the degree of it appropriating power it digestive power to speak figuratively and in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is not so and so but is only allowed to pa a such a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary outoftheway narrowness and mystery of the toonear of the foreground of the magnified the diminished the misshapen the beautifiedan enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestation of power finally in this connection there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirit and dissemble before themthe constant pressing and straining of a creating shaping changeable power the spirit enjoys therein it craftiness and it variety of disguise it enjoys also it feeling of security thereinit is precisely by it protean art that it is best protected and concealedcounter to this propensity for appearance for simplification for a disguise for a cloak in short for an outsidefor every outside is a cloakthere operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge which take and insists on taking thing profoundly variously and thoroughly a a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself provided a it ought to be that he ha sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe word he will say there is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so in fact it would sound nicer if instead of our cruelty perhaps our extravagant honesty were talked about whispered about and glorifiedwe free very free spiritsand some day perhaps such will actually be ourposthumous glory meanwhilefor there is plenty of time until thenwe should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage our whole former work ha just made u sick of this taste and it sprightly exuberance they are beautiful glistening jingling festive word honesty love of truth love of wisdom sacrifice for knowledge heroism of the truthfulthere is something in them that make one heart swell with pride but we anchorite and marmot have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite conscience that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment frippery and golddust of unconscious human vanity and that even under such flattering colour and repainting the terrible original text homo natura must again be recognized in effect to translate man back again into nature to master the many vain and visionary interpretation and subordinate meaning which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text homo natura to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man a he now hardened by the discipline of science stand before the other form of nature with fearless oedipuseyes and stopped ulyssesears deaf to the enticement of old metaphysical birdcatchers who have piped to him far too long thou art more thou art higher thou hast a different originthis may be a strange and foolish task but that it is a task who can deny why did we choose it this foolish task or to put the question differently why knowledge at all every one will ask u about this and thus pressed we who have asked ourselves the question a hundred time have not found and can not find any better answer 231 learning alters u it doe what all nourishment doe that doe not merely conserveas the physiologist know but at the bottom of our soul quite down below there is certainly something unteachable a granite of spiritual fate of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined chosen question in each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable i am this a thinker can not learn anew about man and woman for instance but can only learn fullyhe can only follow to the end what is fixed about them in himself occasionally we find certain solution of problem which make strong belief for u perhaps they are henceforth called conviction later onone see in them only footstep to selfknowledge guidepost to the problem which we ourselves areor more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody our spiritual fate the unteachable in u quite down belowin view of this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truth about woman a she is provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merelymy truth 232 woman wish to be independent and therefore she begin to enlighten men about woman a she isthis is one of the worst development of the general uglifying of europe for what must these clumsy attempt of feminine scientificality and selfexposure bring to light woman ha so much cause for shame in woman there is so much pedantry superficiality schoolmasterliness petty presumption unbridledness and indiscretion concealedstudy only woman behaviour towards childrenwhich ha really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the fear of man ala if ever the eternally tedious in womanshe ha plenty of itis allowed to venture forth if she begin radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and artof charming of playing of frightening away sorrow of alleviating and taking easily if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable desire female voice are already raised which by saint aristophanes make one afraidwith medical explicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last requires from man is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus set herself up to be scientific enlightenment hitherto ha fortunately been men affair men giftwe remained therewith among ourselves and in the end in view of all that woman write about woman we may well have considerable doubt a to whether woman really desire enlightenment about herselfand can desire it if woman doe not thereby seek a new ornament for herselfi believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally femininewhy then she wish to make herself feared perhaps she thereby wish to get the mastery but she doe not want truthwhat doe woman care for truth from the very first nothing is more foreign more repugnant or more hostile to woman than truthher great art is falsehood her chief concern is appearance and beauty let u confess it we men we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman we who have the hard task and for our recreation gladly seek the company of being under whose hand glance and delicate folly our seriousness our gravity and profundity appear almost like folly to u finally i ask the question did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman mind or justice in a woman heart and is it not true that on the whole woman ha hitherto been most despised by woman herself and not at all by uswe men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening u just a it wa man care and the consideration for woman when the church decreed mulier taceat in ecclesia it wa to the benefit of woman when napoleon gave the too eloquent madame de stael to understand mulier taceat in politicisand in my opinion he is a true friend of woman who call out to woman today mulier taceat de mulierel 233 it betrays corruption of the instinctsapart from the fact that it betrays bad tastewhen a woman refers to madame roland or madame de stael or monsieur george sand a though something were proved thereby in favour of woman a she is among men these are the three comical woman a they arenothing moreand just the best involuntary counterargument against feminine emancipation and autonomy 234 stupidity in the kitchen woman a cook the terrible thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed woman doe not understand what food mean and she insists on being cook if woman had been a thinking creature she should certainly a cook for thousand of year have discovered the most important physiological fact and should likewise have got possession of the healing art through bad female cooksthrough the entire lack of reason in the kitchenthe development of mankind ha been longest retarded and most interfered with even today matter are very little better a word to high school girl 235 there are turn and cast of fancy there are sentence little handful of word in which a whole culture a whole society suddenly crystallises itself among these is the incidental remark of madame de lambert to her son mon ami ne vous permettez jamais que de folie qui vous feront grand plaisirthe motherliest and wisest remark by the way that wa ever addressed to a son 236 i have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what dante and goethe believed about womanthe former when he sang ella guardava suso ed io in lei and the latter when he interpreted it the eternally feminine draw u aloft for this is just what she belief of the eternally masculine 237 seven apophthegm for woman how the longest ennui flees when a man come to our knee age ala and science staid

come down among them from an elevation a something delicate fragile wild strange sweet and animatingbut a something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away 238 to be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile tension to dream here perhaps of equal right equal training equal claim and obligation that is a typical sign of shallowmindedness and a thinker who ha proved himself shallow at this dangerous spotshallow in instinctmay generally be regarded a suspicious nay more a betrayed a discovered he will probably prove too short for all fundamental question of life future a well a present and will be unable to descend into any of the depth on the other hand a man who ha depth of spirit a well a of desire and ha also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness and easily confounded with them can only think of woman a oriental do he must conceive of her a a possession a confinable property a a being predestined for service and accomplishing her mission thereinhe must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of asia upon the superiority of the instinct of asia a the greek did formerly those best heir and scholar of asiawho a is well known with their increasing culture and amplitude of power from homer to the time of pericles became gradually stricter towards woman in short more oriental how necessary how logical even how humanely desirable this wa let u consider for ourselves 239 the weaker sex ha in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men a at presentthis belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy in the same way a disrespectfulness to old agewhat wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect they want more they learn to make claim the tribute of respect is at last felt to be wellnigh galling rivalry for right indeed actual strife itself would be preferred in a word woman is losing modesty and let u immediately add that she is also losing taste she is unlearning to fear man but the woman who unlearns to fear sacrifice her most womanly instinct that woman should venture forward when the fearinspiring quality in manor more definitely the man in manis no longer either desired or fully developed is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough what is more difficult to understand is that precisely therebywoman deteriorates this is what is happening nowadays let u not deceive ourselves about it wherever the industrial spirit ha triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk woman a clerkess is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation while she thus appropriates new right aspires to be master and inscribes progress of woman on her flag and banner the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness woman retrogrades since the french revolution the influence of woman in europe ha declined in proportion a she ha increased her right and claim and the emancipation of woman insofar a it is desired and demanded by woman themselves and not only by masculine shallowpates thus prof to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instinct there is stupidity in this movement an almost masculine stupidity of which a wellreared womanwho is always a sensible womanmight be heartily ashamed to lose the intuition a to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapon to letherselfgo before man perhaps even to the book where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined artful humility to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man faith in a veiled fundamentally different ideal in woman something eternally necessarily feminine to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved cared for protected and indulged like some delicate strangely wild and often pleasant domestic animal the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society ha entailed and still entail a though slavery were a counterargument and not rather a condition of every higher culture of every elevation of culturewhat doe all this betoken if not a disintegration of womanly instinct a defeminising certainly there are enough of idiotic friend and corrupters of woman among the learned as of the masculine sex who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner and to imitate all the stupidity from which man in europe european manliness sufferswho would like to lower woman to general culture indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics here and there they wish even to make woman into free spirit and literary worker a though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless manalmost everywhere her nerve are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music our latest german music and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function that of bearing robust child they wish to cultivate her in general still more and intend a they say to make the weaker sex strong by culture a if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the cultivating of mankind and his weakeningthat is to say the weakening dissipating and languishing of his force of willhave always kept pace with one another and that the most powerful and influential woman in the world and lastly the mother of napoleon had just to thank their force of willand not their schoolmastersfor their power and ascendancy over men that which inspires respect in woman and often enough fear also is her nature which is more natural than that of man her genuine carnivoralike cunning flexibility her tigerclaws beneath the glove her naivete in egoism her untrainableness and innate wildness the incomprehensibleness extent and deviation of her desire and virtue that which in spite of fear excites one sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat woman is that she seems more afflicted more vulnerable more necessitous of love and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature fear and sympathy it is with these feeling that man ha hitherto stood in the presence of woman always with one foot already in tragedy which rends while it delightswhat and all that is now to be at an end and the disenchantment of woman is in progress the tediousness of woman is slowly evolving oh europe europe we know the horned animal which wa always most attractive to thee from which danger is ever again threatening thee thy old fable might once more become historyan immense stupidity might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away and no god concealed beneath itno only an idea a modern idea chapter viii people and country 240 i heard once again for the first time richard wagner overture to the mastersinger it is a piece of magnificent gorgeous heavy latterday art which ha the pride to presuppose two century of music a still living in order that it may be understoodit is an honour to german that such a pride did not miscalculate what flavour and force what season and clime do we not find mingled in it it impress u at one time a ancient at another time a foreign bitter and too modern it is a arbitrary a it is pompously traditional it is not infrequently roguish still oftener rough and coarseit ha fire and courage and at the same time the loose duncoloured skin of fruit which ripen too late it flow broad and full and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation like a gap that open between cause and effect an oppression that make u dream almost a nightmare but already it broadens and widens anew the old stream of delightthe most manifold delightof old and new happiness including especially the joy of the artist in himself which he refuse to conceal his astonished happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedient here employed the new newly acquired imperfectly tested expedient of art which he apparently betrays to u all in all however no beauty no south nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky nothing of grace no dance hardly a will to logic a certain clumsiness even which is also emphasized a though the artist wished to say to u it is part of my intention a cumbersome drapery something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious a flirring of learned and venerable conceit and witticism something german in the best and worst sense of the word something in the german style manifold formless and inexhaustible a certain german potency and superplenitude of soul which is not afraid to hide itself under the raffinements of decadencewhich perhaps feel itself most at ease there a real genuine token of the german soul which is at the same time young and aged too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity this kind of music express best what i think of the german they belong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrowthey have a yet no today 241 we good european we also have hour when we allow ourselves a warmhearted patriotism a plunge and relapse into old love and narrow viewsi have just given an example of ithours of national excitement of patriotic anguish and all other sort of oldfashioned flood of sentiment duller spirit may perhaps only get done with what confines it operation in u to hour and play itself out in hoursin a considerable time some in half a year others in half a lifetime according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change their material indeed i could think of sluggish hesitating race which even in our rapidly moving europe would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attack of patriotism and soilattachment and return once more to reason that is to say to good europeanism and while digressing on this possibility i happen to become an earwitness of a conversation between two old patriotsthey were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder he ha a much and know a much philosophy a a peasant or a corpsstudent said the onehe is still innocent but what doe that matter nowadays it is the age of the mass they lie on their belly before everything that is massive and so also in politicis a statesman who rear up for them a new tower of babel some monstrosity of empire and power they call greatwhat doe it matter that we more prudent and conservative one do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that give greatness to an action or affair supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtue out of love to a new and doubtful mediocritysupposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to practise politics when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about and when in the depth of their soul they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness emptiness and noisy wrangling of the essentially politicspractising nationssupposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passion and avidity of his people were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency were to depreciate their most radical proclivity subvert their conscience make their mind narrow and their taste nationalwhat a statesman who should do all this which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future if they had a future such a statesman would be great would heundoubtedly replied the other old patriot vehemently otherwise he could not have done it it wa mad perhaps to wish such a thing but perhaps everything great ha been just a mad at it commencementmisuse of word cried his interlocutor contradictorilystrong strong strong and mad not greatthe old men had obviously become heated a they thus shouted their truth in each others face but i in my happiness and apartness considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the strong and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a nationnamely in the deepening of another 242 whether we call it civilization or humanising or progress which now distinguishes the european whether we call it simply without praise or blame by the political formula the democratic movement in europebehind all the moral and political foreground pointed to by such formula an immense physiological process go on which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of european their increasing detachment from the condition under which climatically and hereditarily united race originate their increasing independence of every definite milieu that for century would fain inscribe itself with equal demand on soul and bodythat is to say the slow emergence of an essentially supernational and nomadic specie of man who posse physiologically speaking a maximum of the art and power of adaptation a his typical distinction this process of the evolving european which can be retarded in it tempo by great relapse but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depththe stillraging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it and also the anarchism which is appearing at presentthis process will probably arrive at result on which it naive propagator and panegyrist the apostle of modern idea would least care to reckon the same new condition under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take placea useful industrious variously serviceable and clever gregarious manare in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive quality for while the capacity for adaptation which is every day trying changing condition and begin a new work with every generation almost with every decade make the powerfulness of the type impossible while the collective impression of such future european will probably be that of numerous talkative weakwilled and very handy workman who require a master a commander a they require their daily bread while therefore the democratising of europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for slavery in the most subtle sense of the term the strong man will necessarily in individual and exceptional case become stronger and richer than he ha perhaps ever been beforeowing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling owing to the immense variety of practice art and disguise i meant to say that the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of tyrantstaking the word in all it meaning even in it most spiritual sense 243 i hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the constellation hercules and i hope that the men on this earth will do like the sun and we foremost we good european 244 there wa a time when it wa customary to call german deep by way of distinction but now that the most successful type of new germanism is covetous of quite other honour and perhaps miss smartness in all that ha depth it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation in short whether german depth is not at bottom something different and worseand something from which thank god we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves let u try then to relearn with regard to german depth the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the german soulthe german soul is above all manifold varied in it source aggregated and superimposed rather than actually built this is owing to it origin a german who would embolden himself to assert two soul ala dwell in my breast would make a bad guess at the truth or more correctly he would come far short of the truth about the number of soul a a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of race perhaps even with a preponderance of the prearyan element a the people of the centre in every sense of the term the german are more intangible more ample more contradictory more unknown more incalculable more surprising and even more terrifying than other people are to themselvesthey escape definition and are thereby alone the despair of the french it is characteristic of the german that the question what is german never dy out among them kotzebue certainly knew his german well enough we are known they cried jubilantly to himbut sand also thought he knew them jean paul knew what he wa doing when he declared himself incensed at fichtes lying but patriotic flattery and exaggerationsbut it is probable that goethe thought differently about german from jean paul even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to fichte it is a question what goethe really thought about the germansbut about many thing around him he never spoke explicitly and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silenceprobably he had good reason for it it is certain that it wa not the war of independence that made him look up more joyfully any more than it wa the french revolutionthe event on account of which he reconstructed his faust and indeed the whole problem of man wa the appearance of napoleon there are word of goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity a from a foreign land that which german take a pride in he once defined the famous german turn of mind a indulgence towards it own and others weakness wa he wrong it is characteristic of german that one is seldom entirely wrong about them the german soul ha passage and gallery in it there are cave hidingplaces and dungeon therein it disorder ha much of the charm of the mysterious the german is well acquainted with the bypath to chaos and a everything love it symbol so the german love the cloud and all that is obscure evolving crepuscular damp and shrouded it seems to him that everything uncertain undeveloped selfdisplacing and growing is deep the german himself doe not exist he is becoming he is developing himself development is therefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulasa ruling idea which together with german beer and german music is labouring to germanise all europe foreigner are astonished and attracted by the riddle which the conflicting nature at the basis of the german soul propounds to them riddle which hegel systematised and richard wagner ha in the end set to music goodnatured and spitefulsuch a juxtaposition preposterous in the case of every other people is unfortunately only too often justified in germany one ha only to live for a while among swabians to know this the clumsiness of the german scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical ropedancing and nimble boldness of which all the god have learnt to be afraid if any one wish to see the german soul demonstrated ad oculos let him only look at german taste at german art and manner what boorish indifference to taste how the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul the german drag at his soul he drag at everything he experience he digest his event badly he never get done with them and german depth is often only a difficult hesitating digestion and just a all chronic invalid all dyspeptic like what is convenient so the german love frankness and honesty it is so convenient to be frank and honestthis confidingness this complaisance this showingthecards of german honesty is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up to nowadays it is his proper mephistophelean art with this he can still achieve much the german let himself go and thereby gaze with faithful blue empty german eyesand other country immediately confound him with his dressinggowni meant to say that let german depth be what it willamong ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at itwe shall do well to continue henceforth to honour it appearance and good name and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation a a people of depth for prussian smartness and berlin wit and sand it is wise for a people to pose and let itself be regarded a profound clumsy goodnatured honest and foolish it might even beprofound to do so finally we should do honour to our namewe are not called the tiusche volk deceptive people for nothing 245 the good old time is past it sang itself out in mozarthow happy are we that his rococo still speaks to u that his good company his tender enthusiasm his childish delight in the chinese and it flourish his courtesy of heart his longing for the elegant the amorous the tripping the tearful and his belief in the south can still appeal to something left in u ah some time or other it will be over with itbut who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for beethoven for he wa only the last echo of a break and transition in style and not like mozart the last echo of a great european taste which had existed for century beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down and a future overyoung soul that is always coming there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hopethe same light in which europe wa bathed when it dreamed with rousseau when it danced round the tree of liberty of the revolution and finally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon but how rapidly doe this very sentiment now pale how difficult nowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment how strangely doe the language of rousseau schiller shelley and byron sound to our ear in whom collectively the same fate of europe wa able to speak which knew how to sing in beethovenwhatever german music came afterwards belongs to romanticism that is to say to a movement which historically considered wa still shorter more fleeting and more superficial than that great interlude the transition of europe from rousseau to napoleon and to the rise of democracy weberbut what do we care nowadays for freischutz and oberon or marschners han heiling and vampyre or even wagner tannhauser that is extinct although not yet forgotten music this whole music of romanticism besides wa not noble enough wa not musical enough to maintain it position anywhere but in the theatre and before the mass from the beginning it wa secondrate music which wa little thought of by genuine musician it wa different with felix mendelssohn that halcyon master who on account of his lighter purer happier soul quickly acquired admiration and wa equally quickly forgotten a the beautiful episode of german music but with regard to robert schumann who took thing seriously and ha been taken seriously from the firsthe wa the last that founded a schooldo we not now regard it a a satisfaction a relief a deliverance that this very romanticism of schumann ha been surmounted schumann fleeing into the saxon switzerland of his soul with a half wertherlike half jeanpaullike nature assuredly not like beethoven assuredly not like byronhis manfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice schumann with his taste which wa fundamentally a petty taste that is to say a dangerous propensitydoubly dangerous among germansfor quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feeling going constantly apart timidly withdrawing and retiring a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow from the beginning a sort of girl and noli me tangerethis schumann wa already merely a german event in music and no longer a european event a beethoven had been a in a still greater degree mozart had been with schumann german music wa threatened with it greatest danger that of losing the voice for the soul of europe and sinking into a merely national affair 246 what a torture are book written in german to a reader who ha a third ear how indignantly he stand beside the slowly turning swamp of sound without tune and rhythm without dance which german call a book and even the german who read book how lazily how reluctantly how badly he read how many german know and consider it obligatory to know that there is art in every good sentenceart which must be divined if the sentence is to be understood if there is a misunderstanding about it tempo for instance the sentence itself is misunderstood that one must not be doubtful about the rhythmdetermining syllable that one should feel the breaking of the toorigid symmetry a intentional and a a charm that one should lend a fine and patient ear to every staccato and every rubato that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowel and diphthong and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangementwho among bookreading german is complaisant enough to recognize such duty and requirement and to listen to so much art and intention in language after all one just ha no ear for it and so the most marked contrast of style are not heard and the most delicate artistry is a it were squandered on the deafthese were my thought when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two master in the art of prosewriting have been confounded one whose word drop down hesitatingly and coldly a from the roof of a damp cavehe count on their dull sound and echo and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword and from his arm down into his toe feel the dangerous bliss of the quivering oversharp blade which wish to bite hiss and cut 247 how little the german style ha to do with harmony and with the ear is shown by the fact that precisely our good musician themselves write badly the german doe not read aloud he doe not read for the ear but only with his eye he ha put his ear away in the drawer for the time in antiquity when a man readwhich wa seldom enoughhe read something to himself and in a loud voice they were surprised when any one read silently and sought secretly the reason of it in a loud voice that is to say with all the swelling inflection and variation of key and change of tempo in which the ancient public world took delight the law of the written style were then the same a those of the spoken style and these law depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirement of the ear and larynx partly on the strength endurance and power of the ancient lung in the ancient sense a period is above all a physiological whole inasmuch a it is comprised in one breath such period a occur in demosthenes and cicero swelling twice and sinking twice and all in one breath were pleasure to the men of antiquity who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a periodwe have really no right to the big period we modern men who are short of breath in every sense those ancient indeed were all of them dilettante in speaking consequently connoisseur consequently criticsthey thus brought their orator to the highest pitch in the same manner a in the last century when all italian lady and gentleman knew how to sing the virtuosoship of song and with it also the art of melody reached it elevation in germany however until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter it young wing there wa properly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artistical discoursethat delivered from the pulpit the preacher wa the only one in germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word in what manner a sentence strike spring rush flow and come to a close he alone had a conscience in his ear often enough a bad conscience for reason are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a german or almost always too late the masterpiece of german prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of it greatest preacher the bible ha hitherto been the best german book compared with luther bible almost everything else is merely literaturesomething which ha not grown in germany and therefore ha not taken and doe not take root in german heart a the bible ha done 248 there are two kind of genius one which above all engenders and seek to engender and another which willingly let itself be fructified and brings forth and similarly among the gifted nation there are those on whom the woman problem of pregnancy ha devolved and the secret task of forming maturing and perfectingthe greek for instance were a nation of this kind and so are the french and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new mode of lifelike the jew the roman and in all modesty be it asked like the germansnations tortured and enraptured by unknown fever and irresistibly forced out of themselves amorous and longing for foreign race for such a let themselves be fructified and withal imperious like everything conscious of being full of generative force and consequently empowered by the grace of god these two kind of genius seek each other like man and woman but they also misunderstand each otherlike man and woman 249 every nation ha it own tartuffery and call that it virtueone doe not knowcannot know the best that is in one 250 what europe owes to the jewsmany thing good and bad and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst the grand style in morality the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demand of infinite signification the whole romanticism and sublimity of moral questionablenessand consequently just the most attractive ensnaring and exquisite element in those iridescence and allurement to life in the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture it evening sky now glowsperhaps glow out for this we artist among the spectator and philosopher aregrateful to the jew 251 it must be taken into the bargain if various cloud and disturbancesin short slight attack of stupiditypass over the spirit of a people that suffers and want to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition for instance among presentday german there is alternately the antifrench folly the antisemitic folly the antipolish folly the christianromantic folly the wagnerian folly the teutonic folly the prussian folly just look at those poor historian the sybels and treitschkes and their closely bandaged head and whatever else these little obscurations of the german spirit and conscience may be called may it be forgiven me that i too when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground did not remain wholly exempt from the disease but like every one else began to entertain thought about matter which did not concern methe first symptom of political infection about the jew for instance listen to the followingi have never yet met a german who wa favourably inclined to the jew and however decided the repudiation of actual antisemitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself but only against it dangerous excess and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentimenton this point we must not deceive ourselves that germany ha amply sufficient jew that the german stomach the german blood ha difficulty and will long have difficulty in disposing only of this quantity of jewas the italian the frenchman and the englishman have done by mean of a stronger digestionthat is the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct to which one must listen and according to which one must act let no more jew come in and shut the door especially towards the east also towards austriathus command the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain so that it could be easily wiped out easily extinguished by a stronger race the jew however are beyond all doubt the strongest toughest and purest race at present living in europe they know how to succeed even under the worst condition in fact better than under favourable one by mean of virtue of some sort which one would like nowadays to label a vicesowing above all to a resolute faith which doe not need to be ashamed before modern idea they alter only when they do alter in the same way that the russian empire make it conquestas an empire that ha plenty of time and is not of yesterdaynamely according to the principle a slowly a possible a thinker who ha the future of europe at heart will in all his perspective concerning the future calculate upon the jew a he will calculate upon the russian a above all the surest and likeliest factor in the great play and battle of force that which is at present called a nation in europe and is really rather a re facta than nata indeed sometimes confusingly similar to a re ficta et picta is in every case something evolving young easily displaced and not yet a race much le such a race aere perennus a the jew are such nation should most carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and hostility it is certain that the jew if they desiredor if they were driven to it a the antisemites seem to wishcould now have the ascendancy nay literally the supremacy over europe that they are not working and planning for that end is equally certain meanwhile they rather wish and desire even somewhat importunely to be insorbed and absorbed by europe they long to be finally settled authorized and respected somewhere and wish to put an end to the nomadic life to the wandering jewand one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency and make advance to it it possibly betokens a mitigation of the jewish instinct for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the antisemitic bawler out of the country one should make advance with all prudence and with selection pretty much a the english nobility do it stand to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked type of new germanism could enter into relation with the jew with the least hesitation for instance the nobleman officer from the prussian border it would be interesting in many way to see whether the genius for money and patience and especially some intellect and intellectualitysadly lacking in the place referred to could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeyingfor both of which the country in question ha now a classic reputation but here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly teutonomania for i have already reached my serious topic the european problem a i understand it the rearing of a new ruling caste for europe 252 they are not a philosophical racethe english bacon represents an attack on the philosophical spirit generally hobbes hume and locke an abasement and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more than a century it wa against hume that kant uprose and raised himself it wa locke of whom schelling rightly said je meprise locke in the struggle against the english mechanical stultification of the world hegel and schopenhauer along with goethe were of one accord the two hostile brothergeniuses in philosophy who pushed in different direction towards the opposite pole of german thought and thereby wronged each other a only brother will dowhat is lacking in england and ha always been lacking that halfactor and rhetorician knew well enough the absurd muddlehead carlyle who sought to conceal under passionate grimace what he knew about himself namely what wa lacking in carlylereal power of intellect real depth of intellectual perception in short philosophy it is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to christianitythey need it discipline for moralizing and humanizing the englishman more gloomy sensual headstrong and brutal than the germanis for that very reason a the baser of the two also the most pious he ha all the more need of christianity to finer nostril this english christianity itself ha still a characteristic english taint of spleen and alcoholic excess for which owing to good reason it is used a an antidotethe finer poison to neutralize the coarser a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarsemannered people a step towards spiritualization the english coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by christian pantomime and by praying and psalmsinging or more correctly it is thereby explained and differently expressed and for the herd of drunkard and rake who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of methodism and more recently a the salvation army a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can be elevated so much may reasonably be admitted that however which offends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music to speak figuratively and also literally he ha neither rhythm nor dance in the movement of his soul and body indeed not even the desire for rhythm and dance for music listen to him speaking look at the most beautiful englishwoman walkingin no country on earth are there more beautiful dove and swan finally listen to them singing but i ask too much 253 there are truth which are best recognized by mediocre mind because they are best adapted for them there are truth which only posse charm and seductive power for mediocre spiritsone is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion now that the influence of respectable but mediocre englishmeni may mention darwin john stuart mill and herbert spencerbegins to gain the ascendancy in the middleclass region of european taste indeed who could doubt that it is a useful thing for such mind to have the ascendancy for a time it would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring mind a specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common fact and deducing conclusion from them a exception they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are the rule after all they have more to do than merely to perceivein effect they have to be something new they have to signify something new they have to represent new value the gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater and also more mysterious than one think the capable man in the grand style the creator will possibly have to be an ignorant personwhile on the other hand for scientific discovery like those of darwin a certain narrowness aridity and industrious carefulness in short something english may not be unfavourable for arriving at themfinally let it not be forgotten that the english with their profound mediocrity brought about once before a general depression of european intelligence what is called modern idea or the idea of the eighteenth century or french ideasthat consequently against which the german mind rose up with profound disgustis of english origin there is no doubt about it the french were only the ape and actor of these idea their best soldier and likewise ala their first and profoundest victim for owing to the diabolical anglomania of modern idea the ame francais ha in the end become so thin and emaciated that at present one recall it sixteenth and seventeenth century it profound passionate strength it inventive excellency almost with disbelief one must however maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined manner and defend it against present prejudice and appearance the european noblesseof sentiment taste and manner taking the word in every high senseis the work and invention of france the european ignobleness the plebeianism of modern ideasis england work and invention 254 even at present france is still the seat of the most intellectual and refined culture of europe it is still the high school of taste but one must know how to find this france of taste he who belongs to it keep himself well concealedthey may be a small number in whom it life and is embodied besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest leg in part fatalist hypochondriac invalid in part person overindulged overrefined such a have the ambition to conceal themselves they have all something in common they keep their ear closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic bourgeois in fact a besotted and brutalized france at present sprawl in the foregroundit recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste and at the same time of selfadmiration at the funeral of victor hugo there is also something else common to them a predilection to resist intellectual germanizingand a still greater inability to do so in this france of intellect which is also a france of pessimism schopenhauer ha perhaps become more at home and more indigenous than he ha ever been in germany not to speak of heinrich heine who ha long ago been reincarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrist of paris or of hegel who at present in the form of tainethe first of living historiansexercises an almost tyrannical influence a regard richard wagner however the more french music learns to adapt itself to the actual need of the ame moderne the more will it wagnerite one can safely predict that beforehandit is already taking place sufficiently there are however three thing which the french can still boast of with pride a their heritage and possession and a indelible token of their ancient intellectual superiority in europe in spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing and vulgarizing of taste firstly the capacity for artistic emotion for devotion to form for which the expression lart pour lart along with numerous others ha been inventedsuch capacity ha not been lacking in france for three century and owing to it reverence for the small number it ha again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible which is sought for in vain elsewhere in europethe second thing whereby the french can lay claim to a superiority over europe is their ancient manysided moralistic culture owing to which one find on an average even in the petty romanciers of the newspaper and chance boulevardier de paris a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity of which for example one ha no conception to say nothing of the thing itself in germany the german lack a couple of century of the moralistic work requisite thereto which a we have said france ha not grudged those who call the german naive on that account give them commendation for a defect a the opposite of the german inexperience and innocence in voluptate psychologica which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of german intercourseand a the most successful expression of genuine french curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrill henri beyle may be noted that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man who with a napoleonic tempo traversed his europe in fact several century of the european soul a a surveyor and discoverer thereofit ha required two generation to overtake him one way or other to divine long afterwards some of the riddle that perplexed and enraptured himthis strange epicurean and man of interrogation the last great psychologist of francethere is yet a third claim to superiority in the french character there is a successful halfway synthesis of the north and south which make them comprehend many thing and enjoins upon them other thing which an englishman can never comprehend their temperament turned alternately to and from the south in which from time to time the provencal and ligurian blood froth over preserve them from the dreadful northern greyingrey from sunless conceptualspectrism and from poverty of bloodour german infirmity of taste for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment blood and iron that is to say high politics ha with great resolution been prescribed according to a dangerous healing art which bid me wait and wait but not yet hopethere is also still in france a preunderstanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism and know how to love the south when in the north and the north when in the souththe born midlanders the good european for them bizet ha made music this latest genius who ha seen a new beauty and seductionwho ha discovered a piece of the south in music 255 i hold that many precaution should be taken against german music suppose a person love the south a i love itas a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ill a a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereign existence believing in itselfwell such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against german music because in injuring his taste anew it will also injure his health anew such a southerner a southerner not by origin but by belief if he should dream of the future of music must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the north and must have in his ear the prelude to a deeper mightier and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music a supergerman music which doe not fade pale and die away a all german music doe at the sight of the blue wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of skya supereuropean music which hold it own even in presence of the brown sunset of the desert whose soul is akin to the palmtree and can be at home and can roam with big beautiful lonely beast of prey i could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil only that here and there perhaps some sailor homesickness some golden shadow and tender weakness might sweep lightly over it an art which from the far distance would see the colour of a sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world fleeing towards it and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitive 256 owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationalitycraze ha induced and still induces among the nation of europe owing also to the shortsighted and hastyhanded politician who with the help of this craze are at present in power and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policyowing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present the most unmistakable sign that europe wish to be one are now overlooked or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted with all the more profound and largeminded men of this century the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their soul wa to prepare the way for that new synthesis and tentatively to anticipate the european of the future only in their simulation or in their weaker moment in old age perhaps did they belong to the fatherlandsthey only rested from themselves when they became patriot i think of such men a napoleon goethe beethoven stendhal heinrich heine schopenhauer it must not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstanding genius like him have seldom the right to understand themselves still le of course by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in france the fact remains nevertheless that richard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forty are most closely and intimately related to one another they are akin fundamentally akin in all the height and depth of their requirement it is europe the one europe whose soul press urgently and longingly outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous artwhither into a new light towards a new sun but who would attempt to express accurately what all these master of new mode of speech could not express distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them that they sought in the same manner these last great seeker all of them steeped in literature to their eye and earsthe first artist of universal literary culturefor the most part even themselves writer poet intermediary and blender of the art and the sen wagner a musician is reckoned among painter a poet among musician a artist generally among actor all of them fanatic for expression at any costi specially mention delacroix the nearest related to wagner all of them great discoverer in the realm of the sublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverer in effect in display in the art of the

the whole a boldly daring splendidly overbearing highflying and aloftupdragging class of higher men who had first to teach their centuryand it is the century of the massesthe conception higher man let the german friend of richard wagner advise together a to whether there is anything purely german in the wagnerian art or whether it distinction doe not consist precisely in coming from supergerman source and impulse in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable paris wa to the development of his type which the strength of his instinct made him long to visit at the most decisive timeand how the whole style of his proceeding of his selfapostolate could only perfect itself in sight of the french socialistic original on a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found to the honour of richard wagner german nature that he ha acted in everything with more strength daring severity and elevation than a nineteenthcentury frenchman could have doneowing to the circumstance that we german are a yet nearer to barbarism than the frenchperhaps even the most remarkable creation of richard wagner is not only at present but for ever inaccessible incomprehensible and inimitable to the whole latterday latin race the figure of siegfried that very free man who is probably far too free too hard too cheerful too healthy too anticatholic for the taste of old and mellow civilized nation he may even have been a sin against romanticism this antilatin siegfried well wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad day whenanticipating a taste which ha meanwhile passed into politicshe began with the religious vehemence peculiar to him to preach at least the way to rome if not to walk thereinthat these last word may not be misunderstood i will call to my aid a few

every elevation of the type man ha hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always bea society believing in a long scale of gradation of rank and difference of worth among human being and requiring slavery in some form or other without the pathos of distance such a grows out of the incarnated difference of class out of the constant outlooking and downlooking of the ruling caste on subordinate and instrument and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding of keeping down and keeping at a distancethat other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself the formation of ever higher rarer further more extended more comprehensive state in short just the elevation of the type man the continued selfsurmounting of man to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense to be sure one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusion about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society that is to say of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type man the truth is hard let u acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto ha originated men with a still natural nature barbarian in every terrible sense of the word men of prey still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power threw themselves upon weaker more moral more peaceful race perhaps trading or cattlerearing community or upon old mellow civilization in which the final vital force wa flickering out in brilliant firework of wit and depravity at the commencement the noble caste wa always the barbarian caste their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical but in their psychical powerthey were more complete men which at every point also implies the same a more complete beast 258 corruptionas the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instinct and that the foundation of the emotion called life is convulsedis something radically different according to the organization in which it manifest itself when for instance an aristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revolution flung away it privilege with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of it moral sentiment it wa corruptionit wa really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for century by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step it lordly prerogative and lowered itself to a function of royalty in the end even to it decoration and paradedress the essential thing however in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself a a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth but a the significance and highest justification thereofthat it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individual who for it sake must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men to slave and instrument it fundamental belief must be precisely that society is not allowed to exist for it own sake but only a a foundation and scaffolding by mean of which a select class of being may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duty and in general to a higher existence like those sunseeking climbing plant in javathey are called sipo matadorwhich encircle an oak so long and so often with their arm until at last high above it but supported by it they can unfold their top in the open light and exhibit their happiness 259 to refrain mutually from injury from violence from exploitation and put one will on a par with that of others this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individual when the necessary condition are given namely the actual similarity of the individual in amount of force and degree of worth and their corelation within one organization a soon however a one wished to take this principle more generally and if possible even a the fundamental principle of society it would immediately disclose what it really isnamely a will to the denial of life a principle of dissolution and decay here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness life itself is essentially appropriation injury conquest of the strange and weak suppression severity obtrusion of peculiar form incorporation and at the least putting it mildest exploitationbut why should one for ever use precisely these word on which for age a disparaging purpose ha been stamped even the organization within which a wa previously supposed the individual treat each other a equalit take place in every healthy aristocracymust itself if it be a living and not a dying organization do all that towards other body which the individual within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated will to power it will endeavour to grow to gain ground attract to itself and acquire ascendancynot owing to any morality or immorality but because it life and because life is precisely will to power on no point however is the ordinary consciousness of european more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter people now rave everywhere even under the guise of science about coming condition of society in which the exploiting character is to be absentthat sound to my ear a if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic function exploitation doe not belong to a depraved or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being a a primary organic function it is a consequence of the intrinsic will to power which is precisely the will to lifegranting that a a theory this is a noveltyas a reality it is the fundamental fact of all history let u be so far honest towards ourselves 260 in a tour through the many finer and coarser morality which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth i found certain trait recurring regularly together and connected with one another until finally two primary type revealed themselves to me and a radical distinction wa brought to light there is mastermorality and slavemoralityi would at once add however that in all higher and mixed civilization there are also attempt at the reconciliation of the two morality but one find still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them indeed sometimes their close juxtapositioneven in the same man within one soul the distinction of moral value have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruledor among the ruled class the slave and dependent of all sort in the first case when it is the ruler who determine the conception good it is the exalted proud disposition which is regarded a the distinguishing feature and that which determines the order of rank the noble type of man separate from himself the being in whom the opposite of this exalted proud disposition display itself he despises them let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad mean practically the same a noble and despicablethe antithesis good and evil is of a different origin the cowardly the timid the insignificant and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised moreover also the distrustful with their constrained glance the selfabasing the doglike kind of men who let themselves be abused the mendicant flatterer and above all the liarsit is a fundamental belief of all aristocrat that the common people are untruthful we truthful onesthe nobility in ancient greece called themselves it is obvious that everywhere the designation of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to action it is a gross mistake therefore when historian of moral start with question like why have sympathetic action been praised the noble type of man regard himself a a determiner of value he doe not require to be approved of he pas the judgment what is injurious to me is injurious in itself he know that it is he himself only who confers honour on thing he is a creator of value he honour whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equal selfglorification in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude of power which seek to overflow the happiness of high tension the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestowthe noble man also help the unfortunate but notor scarcelyout of pity but rather from an impulse generated by the superabundance of power the noble man honour in himself the powerful one him also who ha power over himself who know how to speak and how to keep silence who take pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness and ha reverence for all that is severe and hard wotan placed a hard heart in my breast say an old scandinavian saga it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud viking such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy the hero of the saga therefore add warningly he who ha not a hard heart when young will never have one the noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which see precisely in sympathy or in acting for the good of others or in desinteressement the characteristic of the moral faith in oneself pride in oneself a radical enmity and irony towards selflessness belong a definitely to noble morality a do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heartit is the powerful who know how to honour it is their art their domain for invention the profound reverence for age and for traditionall law rest on this double reverencethe belief and prejudice in favour of ancestor and unfavourable to newcomer is typical in the morality of the powerful and if reversely men of modern idea believe almost instinctively in progress and the future and are more and more lacking in respect for old age the ignoble origin of these idea ha complacently betrayed itself thereby a morality of the ruling class however is more especially foreign and irritating to presentday taste in the sternness of it principle that one ha duty only to one equal that one may act towards being of a lower rank towards all that is foreign just a seems good to one or a the heart desire and in any case beyond good and evil it is here that sympathy and similar sentiment can have a place the ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revengeboth only within the circle of equalsartfulness in retaliation raffinement of the idea in friendship a certain necessity to have enemy a outlet for the emotion of envy quarrelsomeness arrogancein fact in order to be a good friend all these are typical characteristic of the noble morality which a ha been pointed out is not the morality of modern idea and is therefore at present difficult to realize and also to unearth and discloseit is otherwise with the second type of morality slavemorality supposing that the abused the oppressed the suffering the unemancipated the weary and those uncertain of themselves should moralize what will be the common element in their moral estimate probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation the slave ha an unfavourable eye for the virtue of the powerful he ha a skepticism and distrust a refinement of distrust of everything good that is there honouredhe would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine on the other hand those quality which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferer are brought into prominence and flooded with light it is here that sympathy the kind helping hand the warm heart patience diligence humility and friendliness attain to honour for here these are the most useful quality and almost the only mean of supporting the burden of existence slavemorality is essentially the morality of utility here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evilpower and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised according to slavemorality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to mastermorality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seek to arouse it while the bad man is regarded a the despicable being the contrast attains it maximum when in accordance with the logical consequence of slavemorality a shade of depreciationit may be slight and wellintentionedat last attache itself to the good man of this morality because according to the servile mode of thought the good man must in any case be the safe man he is goodnatured easily deceived perhaps a little stupid un bonhomme everywhere that slavemorality gain the ascendancy language show a tendency to approximate the signification of the word good and stupida last fundamental difference the desire for freedom the instinct for happiness and the refinement of the feeling of liberty belong a necessarily to slavemorals and morality a artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptom of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimatinghence we can understand without further detail why love a a passionit is our european specialtymust absolutely be of noble origin a is well known it invention is due to the provencal poetcavaliers those brilliant ingenious men of the gai saber to whom europe owes so much and almost owes itself 261 vanity is one of the thing which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand he will be tempted to deny it where another kind of man think he see it selfevidently the problem for him is to represent to his mind being who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possessand consequently also do not deserveand who yet believe in this good opinion afterwards this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so selfdisrespectful and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable that he would like to consider vanity an exception and is doubtful about it in most case when it is spoken of he will say for instance i may be mistaken about my value and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely a i rate itthat however is not vanity but selfconceit or in most case that which is called humility and also modesty or he will even say for many reason i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour them and rejoice in all their joy perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in case where i do not share it is useful to me or give promise of usefulnessall this however is not vanity the man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind especially with the aid of history that from time immemorial in all social stratum in any way dependent the ordinary man wa only that which he passed fornot being at all accustomed to fix value he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him it is the peculiar right of master to create value it may be looked upon a the result of an extraordinary atavism that the ordinary man even at present is still always waiting for an opinion about himself and then instinctively submitting himself to it yet by no mean only to a good opinion but also to a bad and unjust one think for instance of the greater part of the selfappreciations and selfdepreciations which believing woman learn from their confessor and which in general the believing christian learns from his church in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and it cause the blending of the blood of master and slave the originally noble and rare impulse of the master to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it ha at all time an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to itand in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger the vain person rejoices over every good opinion which he hears about himself quite apart from the point of view of it usefulness and equally regardless of it truth or falsehood just a he suffers from every bad opinion for he subject himself to both he feel himself subjected to both by that oldest instinct of subjection which break forth in himit is the slave in the vain man blood the remains of the slave craftinessand how much of the slave is still left in woman for instancewhich seek to seduce to good opinion of itself it is the slave too who immediately afterwards fall prostrate himself before these opinion a though he had not called them forthand to repeat it again vanity is an atavism 262 a specie originates and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant unfavourable condition on the other hand it is known by the experience of breeder that specie which receive superabundant nourishment and in general a surplus of protection and care immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variation and are fertile in prodigy and monstrosity also in monstrous vice now look at an aristocratic commonwealth say an ancient greek polis or venice a a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of rearing human being there are there men beside one another thrown upon their own resource who want to make their specie prevail chiefly because they must prevail or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated the favour the superabundance the protection are there lacking under which variation are fostered the specie need itself a specie a something which precisely by virtue of it hardness it uniformity and simplicity of structure can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with it neighbour or with rebellious or rebellionthreatening vassal the most varied experience teach it what are the quality to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all god and men and ha hitherto been victorious these quality it call virtue and these virtue alone it develops to maturity it doe so with severity indeed it desire severity every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth in the control of woman in the marriage custom in the relation of old and young in the penal law which have an eye only for the degenerating it count intolerance itself among the virtue under the name of justice a type with few but very marked feature a specie of severe warlike wisely silent reserved and reticent men and a such with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuance of society is thus established unaffected by the vicissitude of generation the constant struggle with uniform unfavourable condition is a already remarked the cause of a type becoming stable and hard finally however a happy state of thing result the enormous tension is relaxed there are perhaps no more enemy among the neighbouring people and the mean of life even of the enjoyment of life are present in superabundance with one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs it is no longer regarded a necessary a a condition of existenceif it would continue it can only do so a a form of luxury a an archaizing taste variation whether they be deviation into the higher finer and rarer or deterioration and monstrosity appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dare to be individual and detach himself at this turningpoint of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virginforestlike upgrowth and upstriving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and selfdestruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoism which strive with one another for sun and light and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by mean of the hitherto existing morality it wa this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously which bent the bow in so threatening a mannerit is now out of date it is getting out of date the dangerous and disquieting point ha been reached when the greater more manifold more comprehensive life is lived beyond the old morality the individual stand out and is obliged to have recourse to his own lawgiving his own art and artifice for selfpreservation selfelevation and selfdeliverance nothing but new why s nothing but new how s no common formula any longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desire frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopia of good and bad a portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charm and mystery peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied corruption danger is again present the mother of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recess of their desire and volition what will the moral philosopher who appear at this time have to preach they discover these sharp onlooker and loafer that the end is quickly approaching that everything around them decay and produce decay that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow except one specie of man the incurably mediocre the mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselvesthey will be the men of the future the sole survivor be like them become mediocre is now the only morality which ha still a significance which still obtains a hearingbut it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it desire it ha to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly loveit will have difficulty in concealing it irony 263 there is an instinct for rank which more than anything else is already the sign of a high rank there is a delight in the nuance of reverence which lead one to infer noble origin and habit the refinement goodness and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something pas by that is of the highest rank but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touch and incivility something that go it way like a living touchstone undistinguished undiscovered and tentative perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised he whose task and practice it is to investigate soul will avail himself of many variety of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul the unalterable innate order of rank to which it belongs he will test it by it instinct for reverence difference engendre haine the vulgarity of many a nature spurt up suddenly like dirty water when any holy vessel any jewel from closed shrine any book bearing the mark of great destiny is brought before it while on the other hand there is an involuntary silence a hesitation of the eye a cessation of all gesture by which it is indicated that a soul feel the nearness of what is worthiest of respect the way in which on the whole the reverence for the bible ha hitherto been maintained in europe is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manner which europe owes to christianity book of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority in order to acquire the period of thousand of year which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them much ha been achieved when the sentiment ha been at last instilled into the mass the shallowpates and the booby of every kind that they are not allowed to touch everything that there are holy experience before which they must take off their shoe and keep away the unclean handit is almost their highest advance towards humanity on the contrary in the socalled cultured class the believer in modern idea nothing is perhaps so repulsive a their lack of shame the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch taste and finger everything and it is possible that even yet there is more relative nobility of taste and more tact for reverence among the people among the lower class of the people especially among peasant than among the newspaperreading demimonde of intellect the cultured class 264 it can not be effaced from a man soul what his ancestor have preferably and most constantly done whether they were perhaps diligent economizer attached to a desk and a cashbox modest and citizenlike in their desire modest also in their virtue or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night fond of rude pleasure and probably of still ruder duty and responsibility or whether finally at one time or another they have sacrificed old privilege of birth and possession in order to live wholly for their faithfor their godas men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience which blush at every compromise it is quite impossible for a man not to have the quality and predilection of his parent and ancestor in his constitution whatever appearance may suggest to the contrary this is the problem of race granted that one know something of the parent it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child any kind of offensive incontinence any kind of sordid envy or of clumsy selfvauntingthe three thing which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all timessuch must pa over to the child a surely a bad blood and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in deceiving with regard to such heredityand what else doe education and culture try to do nowadays in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceivingdeceiving with regard to origin with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul an educator who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else and called out constantly to his pupil be true be natural show yourselves a you areeven such a virtuous and sincere a would learn in a short time to have recourse to the furca of horace naturam expellere with what result plebeianism

a we other being must naturally be in subjection and have to sacrifice themselves the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather a something that may have it basis in the primary law of thingsif he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself he acknowledges under certain circumstance which made him hesitate at first that there are other equally privileged one a soon a he ha settled this question of rank he move among those equal and equally privileged one with the same assurance a regard modesty and delicate respect which he enjoys in intercourse with himselfin accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the star understand it is an additional

more or le definite mental symbol for frequently returning and concurring sensation for group of sensation it is not sufficient to use the same word in order to understand one another we must also employ the same word for the same kind of internal experience we must in the end have experience in common on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nation even when they use the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar condition of climate soil danger requirement toil there originates therefrom an entity that understands itselfnamely a nation in all soul a like number of frequently recurring experience have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely about these matter people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidlythe history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in dangerthat is what can not at all be dispensed with in intercourse also in all love and friendship one ha the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery ha been made that in using the same word one of the two party ha feeling thought intuition wish or fear different from those of the other the fear of the eternal misunderstanding that is the good genius which so often keep person of different sex from too hasty attachment to which sense and heart prompt themand not some schopenhauerian genius of the specie whichever group of sensation within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of commandthese decide a to

it intrinsic need supposing now that necessity ha from all time drawn together only such men a could express similar requirement and similar experience by similar symbol it result on the whole that the easy communicability of need which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and common experience must have been the most potent of all the force which have hitherto operated upon mankind the more similar the more ordinary people have always had and are still having the advantage the more select more refined more unique and difficultly comprehensible are liable to stand alone they succumb to accident in their isolation and seldom propagate themselves one must appeal to immense opposing force in order to thwart this natural alltoonatural progressus in simile the evolution of man to the similar the ordinary the average the gregariousto the ignoble 269 the more a psychologista born an unavoidable psychologist and souldivinerturns his attention to the more select case and individual the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy he need sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man for the corruption the ruination of higher men of the more unusually constituted soul is in fact the rule it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one eye the manifold torment of the psychologist who ha discovered this ruination who discovers once and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history this universal inner desperateness of higher men this eternal too late in every sensemay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot and of his making an attempt at selfdestructionof his going to ruin himself one may perceive in almost every psychologist a telltale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and wellordered men the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing that he need a sort of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight and incisivenessfrom what his businesshas laid upon his conscience the fear of his memory is peculiar to him he is easily silenced by the judgment of others he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour admire love and glorify where he ha perceivedor he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that precisely where he ha learnt great sympathy together with great contempt the multitude the educated and the visionary have on their part learnt great reverencereverence for great men and marvelous animal for the sake of whom one blesses and honour the fatherland the earth the dignity of mankind and one own self to whom one point the young and in view of whom one educates them and who know but in all great instance hitherto just the same happened that the multitude worshipped a god and that the god wa only a poor sacrificial animal success ha always been the greatest liarand the work itself is a success the great statesman the conqueror the discoverer are disguised in their creation until they are unrecognizable the work of the artist of the philosopher only invents him who ha created it is reputed to have created it the great men a they are reverenced are poor little fiction composed afterwards in the world of historical value spurious coinage prevails those great poet for example such a byron musset poe leopardi kleist gogol i do not venture to mention much greater name but i have them in my mind a they now appear and were perhaps obliged to be men of the moment enthusiastic sensuous and childish lightminded and impulsive in their trust and distrust with soul in which usually some flaw ha to be concealed often taking revenge with their work for an internal defilement often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory often lost in the mud and almost in love with it until they become like the willothewisps around the swamp and pretend to be starsthe people then call them idealistsoften struggling with protracted disgust with an everreappearing phantom of disbelief which make them cold and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour faith a it is out of the hand of intoxicated adulatorswhat a torment these great artist are and the socalled higher men in general to him who ha once found them out it is thus conceivable that it is just from womanwho is clairvoyant in the world of suffering and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powersthat they have learnt so readily those outbreak of boundless devoted sympathy which the multitude above all the reverent multitude do not understand and overwhelm with prying and selfgratifying interpretation this sympathizing invariably deceives itself a to it power woman would like to believe that love can do everythingit is the superstition peculiar to her ala he who know the heart find out how poor helpless pretentious and blundering even the best and deepest love ishe find that it rather destroys than savesit is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of jesus there is hidden one of the most painful case of the martyrdom of knowledge about love the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart that never had enough of any human love that demanded love that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else with terrible outburst against those who refused him their love the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love that had to invent hell to send thither those who would not love himand that at last enlightened about human love had to invent a god who is entire love entire capacity for lovewho take pity on human love because it is so paltry so ignorant he who ha such sentiment he who ha such knowledge about loveseeks for deathbut why should one deal with such painful matter provided of course that one is not obliged to do so 270 the intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who ha suffered deeplyit almost determines the order of rank how deeply men can sufferthe chilling certainty with which he is thoroughly imbued and coloured that by virtue of his suffering he know more

pride of the elect of knowledge of the initiated of the almost sacrificed find all form of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with officious and sympathizing hand and in general from all that is not it equal in suffering profound suffering make noble it separatesone of the most refined form of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which take suffering lightly and put itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound they are gay men who make use of gaiety because they are misunderstood on account of itthey wish to be misunderstood there are scientific mind who make use of science because it give a gay appearance and because scientificness lead to the conclusion that a person is superficialthey wish to mislead to a false conclusion there are free insolent mind which would fain conceal and deny that they are broken proud incurable heart the cynicism of hamletthe case of galiani and occasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate overassured knowledgefrom which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place 271 that which separate two men most profoundly is a different sense and grade of purity what doe it matter about all their honesty and reciprocal usefulness what doe it matter about all their mutual goodwill the fact still remainsthey can not smell each other the highest instinct for purity place him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation a a saint for it is just holinessthe highest spiritualization of the instinct in question any kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of night into the morning and out of gloom out of affliction into clearness brightness depth and refinementjust a much a such a tendency distinguishesit is a noble tendencyit also separatesthe pity of the saint is pity for the filth of the human alltoohuman and there are grade and height where pity itself is regarded by him a impurity a filth 272 sign of nobility never to think of lowering our duty to the rank of duty for everybody to be unwilling to renounce or to share our responsibility to count our prerogative and the exercise of them among our duty 273 a man who strives after great thing look upon every one whom he encounter on his way either a a mean of advance or a delay and hindranceor a a temporary restingplace his peculiar lofty bounty to his fellowmen is only possible when he attains his elevation and dominates impatience and the consciousness of being always condemned to comedy up to that timefor even strife is a comedy and conceals the end a every mean doesspoil all intercourse for him this kind of man is acquainted with solitude and what is most poisonous in it 274 the problem of those who waithappy chance are necessary and many incalculable element in order that a higher man in whom the solution of a problem is dormant may yet take action or break forth a one might sayat the right moment on an average it

the foregroundand thereby betrays himself 276 in all kind of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is better off than the nobler soul the danger of the latter must be greater the probability that

owing to an unconquerable distrust of the possibility of selfknowledge which ha led me so far a to feel a contradictio in adjecto even in the idea of direct knowledge which theorist allow themselvesthis matter of fact is almost the most certain thing i know about myself there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myselfis there perhaps some enigma therein probably but fortunately nothing for my own teethperhaps it betrays the specie to which i belongbut not to myself a is sufficiently agreeable to me 282but what ha happened to youi do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpy have flown over my tableit sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle sober retiring man becomes suddenly mad break the plate upset the table shriek raf and shock everybodyand finally withdraws ashamed and raging at himselfwhither for what purpose to famish apart to suffocate with his memoriesto him who ha the desire of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom find his table laid and his food prepared the danger will always be greatnowadays however it is extraordinarily so thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age with which he doe not like to eat out of the same dish he may readily perish of hunger and thirstor should he nevertheless finally fall to of sudden nauseawe have probably all sat at table to which we did not belong and precisely the most spiritual of u who are most difficult to nourish know the dangerous dyspepsia which originates from a sudden insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmatesthe afterdinner nausea 283 if one wish to praise at all it is a delicate and at the same time a noble selfcontrol to praise only where one doe not agreeotherwise in fact one would praise oneself which is contrary to good tastea selfcontrol to be sure which offer excellent opportunity and provocation to constant misunderstanding to be able to allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality one must not live among intellectual imbecile but rather among men whose misunderstanding and mistake amuse by their refinementor one will have to pay dearly for ithe praise me therefore he acknowledges me to be rightthis asinine method of inference spoil half of the life of u recluse for it brings the as into our neighbourhood and friendship 284 to live in a vast and proud tranquility always beyond to have or not to have one emotion one for and against according to choice to lower oneself to them for hour to seat oneself on them a upon horse and often a upon assesfor one must know how to make use of their stupidity a well a of their fire to conserve one three hundred foreground also one black spectacle for there are circumstance when nobody must look into our eye still le into our motif and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness and to remain master of one four virtue courage insight sympathy and solitude for solitude is a virtue with u a a sublime bent and bias to purity which divine that in the contact of man and manin societyit must be unavoidably impure all society make one somehow somewhere or sometimecommonplace 285 the greatest event and thoughtsthe greatest thought however are the greatest eventsare longest in being comprehended the generation which are contemporary with them do not experience such eventsthey live past them something happens there a in the realm of star the light of the furthest star is longest in reaching man and before it ha arrived man deniesthat there are star there how many century doe a mind require to be understoodthat is also a standard one also make a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith such a is necessary for mind and for star 286 here is the prospect free the mind exalted footnote goethe faust part ii act v the word of dr marianusbut there is a reverse kind of man who is also upon a height and ha also a free prospectbut look downwards 287 what is noble what doe the word noble still mean for u nowadays how doe the noble man betray himself how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism by which everything is rendered opaque and leadenit is not his action which establish his claimactions are always ambiguous always inscrutable neither is it his work one find nowadays among artist and scholar plenty of those who betray by their work that a profound longing for nobleness impels them but this very need of nobleness is radically different from the need of the noble soul itself and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof it is not the work but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rankto employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaningit is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul ha about itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and perhaps also is not to be lostthe noble soul ha reverence for itself 288 there are men who are unavoidably intellectual let them turn and twist themselves a they will and hold their hand before their treacherous eyesas though the hand were not a betrayer it always come out at last that they have something which they hidenamely intellect one of the subtlest mean of deceiving at least a long a possible and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really iswhich in everyday life is often a desirable a an umbrellais called enthusiasm including what belongs to it for instance virtue for a galiani said who wa obliged to know it vertu est enthousiasme 289 in the writing of a recluse one always hears something of the echo of the wilderness something of the murmuring tone and timid vigilance of solitude in his strongest word even in his cry itself there sound a new and more dangerous kind of silence of concealment he who ha sat day and night from year end to year end alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse he who ha become a cavebear or a treasureseeker or a treasureguardian and dragon in his caveit may be a labyrinth but can also be a goldminehis idea themselves eventually acquire a twilightcolour of their own and an odour a much of the depth a of the mould something uncommunicative and repulsive which blow chilly upon every passerby the recluse doe not believe that a philosophersupposing that a philosopher ha always in the first place been a recluseever expressed his actual and ultimate opinion in book are not book written precisely to hide what is in usindeed he will doubt whether a philosopher can have ultimate and actual opinion at all whether behind every cave in him there is not and must necessarily be a still deeper cave an ampler stranger richer world beyond the surface an abyss behind every bottom beneath every foundation every philosophy is a foreground philosophythis is a recluse verdict there is something arbitrary in the fact that the philosopher came to a stand here took a retrospect and looked around that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeperthere is also something suspicious in it every philosophy also conceals a philosophy every opinion is also a lurkingplace every word is also a mask 290 every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood the latter perhaps wound his vanity but the former wound his heart his sympathy which always say ah why would you also have a hard a time of it a i have 291 man a complex mendacious artful and inscrutable animal uncanny to the other animal by his artifice and sagacity rather than by his strength ha invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul a something simple and the whole of morality is a long audacious falsification by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible from this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of art than is generally believed 292 a philosopher that is a man who constantly experience see hears suspect hope and dream extraordinary thing who is struck by his own thought a if they came from the outside from above and below a a specie of event and lightningflashes peculiar to him who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightning a portentous man around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on a philosopher ala a being who often run away from himself is often afraid of himselfbut whose curiosity always make him come to himself again 293 a man who say i like that i take it for my own and mean to guard and protect it from every one a man who can conduct a case carry out a resolution remain true to an opinion keep hold of a woman punish and overthrow insolence a man who ha his indignation and his sword and to whom the weak the suffering the oppressed and even the animal willingly submit and naturally belong in short a man who is a master by naturewhen such a man ha sympathy well that sympathy ha value but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer or of those even who preach sympathy there is nowadays throughout almost the whole of europe a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining an effeminizing which with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense seek to deck itself out a something superiorthere is a regular cult of suffering the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by such group of visionary is always i believe the first thing that strike the eyeone must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste and finally i wish people to put the good amulet gai saber gay science in ordinary language on heart and neck a a protection against it 294 the olympian vicedespite the philosopher who a a genuine englishman tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking mindslaughing is a bad infirmity of human nature which every thinking mind will strive to overcome hobbesi would even allow myself to rank philosopher according to the quality of their laughingup to those who are capable of golden laughter and supposing that god also philosophize which i am strongly inclined to believe owing to many reasonsi have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overmanlike and new fashionand at the expense of all serious thing god are fond of ridicule it seems that they can not refrain from laughter even in holy matter 295 the genius of the heart a that great mysterious one posse it the temptergod and born ratcatcher of conscience whose voice can descend into the netherworld of every soul who neither speaks a word nor cast a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he know how to appearnot a he is but in a guise which act a an additional constraint on his follower to press ever closer to him to follow him more cordially and thoroughlythe genius of the heart which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and selfconceited which smoothes rough soul and make them taste a new longingto lie placid a a mirror that the deep heaven may be reflected in themthe genius of the heart which teach the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate and to grasp more delicately which scent the hidden and forgotten treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice and is a diviningrod for every grain of gold long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with which every one go away richer not favoured or surprised not a though gratified and oppressed by the good thing of others but richer in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more bruised but full of hope which a yet lack name full of a new will and current full of a new illwill and countercurrent but what am i doing my friend of whom am i talking to you have i forgotten myself so far that i have not even told you his name unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable god and spirit is that wish to be praised in such a manner for a it happens to every one who from childhood onward ha always been on his leg and in foreign land i have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirit above all however and again and again the one of whom i have just spoken in fact no le a personage than the god dionysus the great equivocator and tempter to whom a you know i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my firstfruitsthe last a it seems to me who ha offered a sacrifice to him for i have found no one who could understand what i wa then doing in the meantime however i have learned much far too much about the philosophy of this god and a i said from mouth to mouthi the last disciple and initiate of the god dionysus and perhaps i might at last begin to give you my friend a far a i am allowed a little taste of this philosophy in a hushed voice a is but seemly for it ha to do with much that is secret new strange wonderful and uncanny the very fact that dionysus is a philosopher and that therefore god also philosophize seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophersamong you my friend there is le to be said against it except that it come too late and not at the right time for a it ha been disclosed to me you are loth nowadays to believe in god and god it may happen too that in the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to the strict usage of your ear certainly the god in question went further very much further in such dialogue and wa always many pace ahead of me indeed if it were allowed i should have to give him according to human usage fine ceremonious tide of lustre and merit i should have to extol his courage a investigator and discoverer his fearless honesty truthfulness and love of wisdom but such a god doe not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp keep that he would say for thyself and those like thee and whoever else require it ihave no reason to cover my nakedness one suspect that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lack shamehe once said under certain circumstance i love mankindand referred thereby to ariadne who wa present in my opinion man is an agreeable brave inventive animal that ha not his equal upon earth he make his way even through all labyrinth i like man and often think how i can still further advance him and make him stronger more evil and more profoundstronger more evil and more profound i asked in horror yes he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more beautifuland thereby the temptergod smiled with his halcyon smile a though he had just paid some charming compliment one here see at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacksand in general there are good ground for supposing that in some thing the god could all of them come to u men for instruction we men aremore human 296 ala what are you after all my written and painted thought not long ago you were so variegated young and malicious so full of thorn and secret spice that you made me sneeze and laughand now you have already doffed your novelty and some of you i fear are ready to become truth so immortal do they look so pathetically honest so tedious and wa it ever otherwise what then do we write and paint we mandarin with chinese brush we immortalisers of thing which lend themselves to writing what are we alone capable of painting ala only that which is just about to fade and begin to lose it odour ala only exhausted and departing storm and belated yellow sentiment ala only bird strayed and fatigued by flight which now let themselves be captured with the handwith our hand we immortalize what can not live and fly much longer thing only which are exhausted and mellow and it is only for your afternoon you my written and painted thought for which alone i
